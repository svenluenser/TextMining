1. INTRODUCTION
=============================================================================

     There are many new and exciting features to be found in Windows95, but
perhaps the most exciting feature is the automatic recording of all the
documents you access so that they can be located and opened at a later
time with a single mouse click.  The need to search through a complex -- and
often confusing -- file system for frequently used documents is now a part
of the past.

     Unfortunately, while implementing this feature, several important
details seem to have been neglected.  People who take advantage of this
wonderful feature are usually people who tend to use many documents.  The
list very quickly becomes crowded with documents no sane person would
want recorded for later use.  How many times, after all, do you want to
read "BBS_ADD.TXT"?

  The document list management system allows you to easily maintain a
  clear and coherent document list in the following ways:

     * You can automatically remove unwanted documents (or document classes)
       from the document list.

     * You can perform common document list management tasks by using an
       icon in the system tray (the area on the taskbar where the time is
       displayed).

     * You can protect one or more documents, thus ensuring that they are
       not removed from the document list by the document list management
       system.

     * You can save and restore complete document lists, which is especially
       useful if there are multiple users on one system (without a network)
       or there are multiple document lists being used by one user.

     * You can add documents to the document list.

     * You can remove one or more documents from the document list.

     * You can remove all documents from the document list.

     The document list maanagement system is ideally suited to novice users
and expert users alike.  When a command that will have a permanent effect
is about to be undertaken, the document list management system can be
instructed to ask for confirmation.  Users who are experts may elect to
disable the confirmations, which may be done on an individual basis, to
improve productivity.

     The document list management system is a completely 32-BIT application
written explicitly for Windows 95.


     What does the press have to say about the document list management
system?  Well...

6. Using The Document List Management System
=============================================================================

--------------------------
- a. System Requirements -
--------------------------

     The document list management system is not an application that will
devour your system resources.  If you would like to use it on your system,
you should have a system with the following components/capabilities:

        386/486/Pentium/Pentium Pro Processor
        Windows 95
        VGA (>=16 Colours)

------------------------
- b. The Document List -
------------------------

     The document list is the heart of this application.  It consists of a
single pane showing the documents currently in your document list, a row of
quick access buttons above the window pane, and a menu where the complete
set of commands is available.  The purpose of each command button is
explained below:

 File Menu

      Open Document(s)

      This command allows you to open a document (or more than one document)
      listed in the document list.  Simply select the document(s) you would
      like to open, then click "Open Document(s)".  The application
      associated with the document will be opened and the document will be
      shown.

      New Shortcut

      This command allows you to manually add a document to the document
      list without actually launching the application associated with the
      document.

      Close Document Window

      This command will exit the Document Window.  It does not exit the
      document list management system, though, so the document window can
      be opened again using the icon in the system tray.

      Exit DLMS

      This command will exit the document list management system.  If you
      select this command, the icon in the system tray will be removed and
      the only way to activate this application again will be to restart
      your computer.

 View Menu

      Refresh

      This command is used to update the document list.  If new documents are
      added to the list while the document list management system is being
      used, clicking this button will add them to the document list.

      Options

      This command will allow you to set the various options available in
      this application.  To obtain more information about the options that
      can be changed, please read the next section of this manual.

 Document Menu

     Protect Document(s)

     There are documents that are accessed so frequently that they should be
     protected from accidental removal from the document list.  If there are
     such documents on your system, you can protect them by selecting each
     document and then selecting this command.  When an attempt is made to
     remove a protected document from the document list (and the
     appropriate option is enabled) you will be asked for
     confirmation before the document is removed.

     NOTE:  This command will only prevent the document list management
            system from removing the document.  If you delete the document
            from the list using any other method (such as the Explorer or
            the Windows 95 "Clear" feature) the document will be removed.

     Remove Document(s)

     If you decide that one or more documents are no longer needed in the
     document list, select them using the mouse and then select this command.
     The selected documents will be removed from the document list
     immediately.

     Remove All Documents

     If you want to remove all documents from the document list, select this
     command.

     Remove All Unprotected

     If you want to remove all documents from the document list that are not
     protected, select this command.

     Save Document List

     If there is more than one user using a computer (but you do not want to
     install all of the networking drivers and software) you can create a
     document list for each user using this command.  It is also a useful
     feature for systems where there is one user with a need for more
     than one specialized document list.

     Restore Document List

     This command allows you to restore a previously saved document list.
     When a document list is restored, the previous index of the document
     list is destroyed by default.  If you do not want the previous index
     of the document list to be destroyed, there is an appropriate option
     available to disable this feature.

 Help Menu

     Help Topics

     This command allows you to find out more information about the document
     list management system and how to use it more effectively.

     About DLMS

     This command allows you to find out more information about the document
     list management system.  This is also the dialog box in which
     registered users can enter their personalized keys to fully unlock the
     application.

--------------
- c. Options -
--------------

     The options dialog box allows you to set various levels of confirmation
before commands that are considered permanent are performed on the document
list.  For novice users, it is advisable to enable all of the confirmations.
As users gain experience with the document list management system,
confirmations can be disabled individually or as a group.

* Ask for confirmation before removing all documents from the document list.

     If this confirmation is enabled, the document list management system
will display a message box asking for confirmation before the contents of
the document list is erased. This action, once taken, is irrevocable.

* Ask for confirmation before removing one or more documents from the
  document list.

     If this confirmation is enabled, the document list management system
will display a message box asking for confirmation before a set of documents
(selected by the user) is removed from the document list.

* Ask for confirmation before removing a protected document from the document
  list.

     Documents that have been protected by the user should not be removed
from the document list.  If this confirmation is enabled, the document list
management system will display a message box asking for confirmation before
a protected document is removed from the document list.  If more than one
protected document is to be removed, confirmation will be requested for each
document.

* Use a non-destructive method of restoring document lists.

     This option prevents the previous index of a document list from being
destroyed when a document list is restored.  This ensures that any documents
currently in the document list are still available after the document list
is restored.  This mode can be though of as "merge" mode, whereas the
default mode can be thought of as "replace" mode.

* Display a summary after each command is completed.

     This option provides extra information about each command that
the document list management system performs on the document list.  When
removing documents, it summarizes the number of documents removed.  When
saving or restoring document lists, it summarizes the number of documents
saved or restored.
