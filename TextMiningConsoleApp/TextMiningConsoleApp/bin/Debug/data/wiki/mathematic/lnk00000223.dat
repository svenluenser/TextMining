Description

  This is a network diagnostic tool that implements PING, Traceroute
  and DNS lookups specifically for Windows 95 and Windows NT.  It may
  work on Windows for Workgroups (Window 3.x) with some network stacks
  when Win32s is installed.

  PING is a network diagnostic tool that verifies connectivity to a
  particular system on the network.  PING sends an ICMP "echo request"
  in the form of a data packet to a remote host, and displays the
  results for each "echo reply".  In essence, PING asks, "Hello host,
  are you there?", and waits for a response.  PING sends one packet
  per second and prints one line of output for every response received.
  When PING terminates, it displays a brief summary of round-trip
  times and packet loss statistics.  When using PING to isolate
  hardware or software problems, first PING "127.0.0.1" (or "localhost")
  to verify that the local network is up and running.  Then, ping
  hosts and gateways further and further away.

  TRACEROUTE is a network diagnostic tool that lets you trace and view
  the actual route an IP packet follows to an Internet host.  It also
  displays response times (in milliseconds), which identify the amount
  of time it takes the packet to travel the route.  Response times will
  vary depending on network load.  TRACEROUTE is useful for finding
  potential trouble spots on large and complex networks that are
  connected together with routers.

  LOOKUP is a tool that lets you query Internet domain servers for
  information about hosts and name servers.  You can use LOOKUP to
  query the name server for information about various hosts and
  domains.
