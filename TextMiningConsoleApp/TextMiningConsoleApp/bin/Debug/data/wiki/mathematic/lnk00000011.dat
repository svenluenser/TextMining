SECRET KEY:

-AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
 .initiated by NIST on 1997
  -3rd public encryption standard
  -to replace DES
 .NIST asked public cryptography community for
  specification, submission & evaluation
 .5 candidates were selected on Round 1:
  -TwoFish, Rijndael, Serpent, MARS, RC6
 .chosen cipher is Rijndael
 .requirement:
  -128 bit data block
  -no weak keys
  -128, 192, 256 bit key
  -suitable as stream cipher, hash function & MAC
  -simple design
  -publicly disclosed, royalty-free, worldwide

-BLOWFISH
 .by Bruce Schneier ('93)
 .proposed as alternative to DES
 .Feistel
 .has weak keys
 .16 round
  -best attack: 4 round
 .four 8x32 bit, 256 entries S-boxes
  repeat its iteration to create S-boxes
 .64-bit block size
 .max 448 bit (56 byte) key length
 .total subkeys 4168 byte
 .operation: XOR & ADD
 .unbroken after 1 year of cryptanalyst sponsored by Dr.Dobb's Journal
 .public domain

-CAST (CArlisle & STafford), CAST-128, CAST-256
 .by Carlisle M. Adams & Stafford E. Tavares of Northern Telecom (Nortel)
 .patented by Nortel, but available for anyone on royalty-free basis
 .128 bit key
 .64 bit data block
 .Feistel
 .designed to specifically resist all known attacks
  -very conservative
  -strongly believed to be immune against linear & differential cryptanalysis
 .no (semi)weak keys
 .used in PGP V5.0+/Philip Zimmerman in 64 bit CFB mode
 .very fast (?)
 .CAST-256 is
  -based on CAST-128

 .by Christian Schneider ('96)
 .Blowfish mutation + extending techniques

-DES: Data Encryption Standard
 .by: Horst Feistel, Walt Tuchman, Carl Meyer et al/IBM ('70)/USA government
 .chosen by NBS (now is NIST) as
  USA (Federal?) goverment first encryption standard (1976)
 .not for classified document
 .most well-known & widely used encryption
  -ciphers after DES following its design: Feistel network, S-boxes,
   product cipher, etc: Khufu, BlowFish, etc
 .for hardware implementation
  -excellent on hardware
  -the initial & final permutation is considered cryptographically useless
   (needed to load to hardware registers?)
  -slow on software (5 to 10 times)
 .Feistel
 .originally 128 bit key, reduced by NSA to 56 bit
  the passphrase usually becomes the key
 .64 bit block size
 .16 round
 .simple key schedule
 .8 6x4 bit S-boxes, content changed by NSA
  -content optimized against differential cryptanalysis
  -differential cryptanalysis already found by IBM while creating DES &
   Lucifer, but NSA classified their research
 .vulnerable to
  -wealthy enemy+brute force (key size is too short)
  -differential cryptanalysis
  -linear cryptanalysis
   .best attack: 2^43 or 64 tera bytes ciphertext/plaintext under 1 key
 .has weak keys
 .not a group
  crypt with 2 key <> crypt with 1 key
 .variant: Triple-DES (3DES)
  -the same data is processed by 3 keys:
   .encrypt with 1st key
   .decrypt with 2nd key
   .encrypt with 3rd key (or 1st key)
  -key length: 168 bit (or 112 bit)
   there's an attack with 2^56 blocks memory that reduces effective key size
    to 112 bit (or 55 bit)
  -if 2 or 3 keys are the same, equal to crypt with only 1 key
  -no patent
 .export approval is almost impossible, even DES already spread overseas
  but now is exportable due to new regulation & new standard (AES)?
 .can be used in several officially defined modes:
  -ECB: Electronic CodeBook
   .crypt each 64-bit block of plaintext
   .weakest mode
  -CBC: Cipher Block Chaining
   .each 64-bit plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block
    before being crypted
   .more secure than ECB, but not against differential cryptanalysis
   .most widely used
  -CFB: Cipher FeedBack (CFB-1, CFB-8?)
   .can crypt block <= 64 bit
   .previous ciphertext bit is also used to produce next ciphertext bit
   .ciphertext error affects current & next ciphertext variables
   .preferred
  -OFB: Output FeedBack
   .can crypt block <= 64 bit
   .the input bit is also used to produce next ciphertext bit
   .no chaining = vulnerable to certain attacks
   .1 bit ciphertext error only affects 1 bit in plaintext
  -PCBC: Propagating Cipher Block Chaining
   .not official mode, used in Kerberos V4
   .single bit error affect the rest of decrypted stream

PUBLIC KEY:
---
invented by Whitfield Diffie & Martin E. Hellman
independently? invented by Ralph C. Merkle
GCHQ, British-NSA like claimed to find public-key cryptography before
 America, but kept the discovery secret:
 -Clifford Cook (a British spook) published (essentially) RSA in 1973
 -M.J. Williamson invented (remarkably similar to) Diffie-Hellman in 1974
NSA sometimes claimed to find public-key cryptography before learning it
 from British or press

-Diffie-Hellman ('70)
 .by Whitfield Diffie & Martin E. Hellman
 .discrete logarithm problem
 .requires dynamic key exchange for every sender-receiver pair
  -A's public key is combined with B's secret key to produce a session key to
   encrypt plaintext
   The ciphertext can only be decrypted by the sesssion key of
   B's public key & A's secret key
 .used by PGP V5+

-KEA (Key Exchange Algorithm)
 .by NSA
 .part of Capstone Project/Clipper Chip
 .classified
  -incapable to supply enough Fortezza, it's declassified on 1998
 .straightforward design
 .enhanced Diffie-Hellman
  -(longterm/onetime) (public/secret) keys -> 4 keys for each party
  -A's longterm secret key is combined with B's onetime public key
   A's onetime secret key is combined with B's longterm public key
  -each session creates 2 unique (combinations & keys)
  -2 Diffie-Hellman-generated keys (2 x 80 bits) are hashed to single 80 bits
   which becomes the key

-Knapsack
 .easy to perform, hard to invert

-ElGamal

 .discrete logarithm problem

-Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem
 .believed to be as secure as RSA with smaller key size
 .all analysis on discrete logarithm problem also applied to it

 .developed at MIT, funded by US federal
 .integer factorization problem
 .Rivest: sometimes being used by US government to protect its nuclear weapon
 .cryptanalyzed without success since 1978
 .requires trusted authority to certificate public key
 .verifying is faster than signing
 .used in PGP/Phillip Zimmerman (at least to 2.63?)
 .various attacks has been found
  -side channel/timing attack: private key can be recovered by measuring
   the relative times cryptographic operations took (1995)
  -implementation attack: on PKCSI #1
  -adaptive chosen plaintext/reaction attack
   .by Daniel Bleichenbacher/Bell Labs
   .can recover a message from 300,000 - 2M related (reaction) messages
    -doesn't recover the key
    -to read another message, require another 300,000 - 2M related messages

-Cramer-Shoup
 .by IBM
 .provable resistance to adaptive chosen ciphertext attack
  -but the proof is based on Diffie-Hellman Decision Problem, which is
   much weaker
 .ciphertext is 4x plaintext
 .2x slower than ElGamal

 (ex: long enough key, random-like output)
 but having those properties doesn't mean that the cryptosystem is secure

-compromise

Advice:
---
-longer key size than designed is worthless because:
 .it isn't designed that way
  the designer doesn't take account of longer key
 .maybe must change the algorithm, which will be insecure
 .if the cipher is broken by design, 1 million bit key wouldn't protect
  the plaintext anymore, while it already wasting time & space & power for
  each key initialization & encrypt/decrypt process
-you should only put crypt elements to your cipher which is proved to be
 hard/impossible to break, instead of scrambling it too much further or
 excessively more complex until it blurred you to trace it anymore & then
 believe it to be secure
