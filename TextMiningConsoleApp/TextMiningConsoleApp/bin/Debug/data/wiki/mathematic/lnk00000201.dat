     UC (tm) is a package designed to patch files!  If you have made patches
or cracks, you would know that if a program was uncompressed, a locational
search will fail.  Ie. Location to search is at 1,000,000 and the string is
"74 05 B8 00 00," but the file was uncompressed differently and the offset
is currently at 1,000,001!  "How frustrating!"  And so you'd need to make
another patch, but you are too lazy!  UC finds your data throughout the
entire file!  That means there are no restrictions to size and time (UC can
find 100M of data in approx. 1:16.68 seconds!).  There are MUCH MUCH more
options to be excited about!  Rather than making another patch, YOU can
decide if you'd like to use, the already made, UC!


     For futher information regarding the UC (tm) package, please read
UCP.TXT, UCC.TXT, and/or LICENSE.TXT.


     UC (tm) is now declared as a ROYALTY-FREE FREEWARE!  UC (tm) is given
as is.  No further updates will be distributed unless there are serious bugs
overlooked.  If you have any questions concerning about UC (tm), e-mail
