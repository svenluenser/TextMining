===== Installation =====================================

                     INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR
          "STRATEGIES TO REDUCE COLLEGE COSTS" (STRATS21.ZIP)

Strategies... is distributed in a compressed file, STRATS21.ZIP. To open
that file, move it to the directory from which you will access it with
your word processor. Then, go to that directory and use the un-zip
utility provided by your bulletin board or CD-ROM to uncompress the file.

Strategies to Reduce College Costs has been stored in Rich Text
Format (RTF)--a Microsoft standard, which may be read by
Microsoft Word and many other word processors. Boot your word
processor, Choose File, Open, File Type: RTF or Rich Text
Format. Then, select the directory where STRATS21.RTF has been
installed, open it and proceed as instructed.

If your word processor is not able to read the STRATS21.RTF
file, you may use your word processor's ASCII file format reader
to open STRATS21.TXT, which has also been included. This format
does not retain all of the nice formatting codes that RTF
handles, such as Font sizes, Bold, Underline and Italics.
However, if this is your only choice, just use your word
processor to add these attributes as you read. Good luck.
