Motherboard Chipsets
---
Athlon/Duron chipset
---
-AMD
 AMD750
 AMD760
  DDR-SDRAM support
  faster than VIA's KT266
 AMD762
  MPS

-ALI
 Magik1
  DDR-SDRAM
  mediocre performance

-VIA
 KX133
  SlotA
  support for 100Mhz (DDRed: 200Mhz) FSB
 KT133
  KX133 with SocketA
 KT133A
  support for 133Mhz (DDRed: 266Mhz) FSB
  very reliable & frequently used
 KT266
  DDR-SDRAM support
  lack of performance
 KT266A
  significantly improved performance from KT266
  currently the fastest Athlon chipset
 ?
  166Mhz DDR (333Mhz) SDRAM
  AGP8x
  PCI X
  Southbridge (VT8235)
   USB v2.0
   FireWire

-SiS
 735
  release: May 2001
  DDR-SDRAM
  faster than VIA's KT266

-NVidia
 n'Force
  release: Oct 2001
  100Mhz AGP bus instead of normal 66Mhz (= normal AGP6x)
  IGP (Integrated Graphic Processor)
   integrated GeForce2 MX
   DASP (Dynamic Adaptive Speculative Pre-Processor)
    8-way set associative prefetch cache
    but it reduces AthlonXP (Palomino) hw data prefetch
  MCP (Media & Communication Processor)
   integrated Ethernet controller
   outfitted with very powerful APU (Audio Processing Unit), a licensed implementation of Parthus's Media
Stream DSP, to support realtime Dolby Digital Encoding
  IGP & MCP is connected through implementation of AMD's Hyper Transport
