Archive-name: alt-hierarchies/part5

relcom
------

Relcom.* is the hierarchy of Russian-language newsgroups distributed
mostly on the territory of the former Soviet Union (non-CIS countries
included).  These groups are available in Europe and Northern America;
due to the 8-bit encoding (KOI-8) of Cyrillic letters, minor software
modifications may be required.

Newsgroups under the hierarchy relcom.commerce contain classified
advertisements and are relatively high-volume; the nature of the
information distributed in those groups may contradict policy of some
networks.  However, they may be valuable for researchers and
businessmen interested in the first-hand information on the economics
of FSU countries.

Dmitri Martynoff <dmart@newcom.kiae.su> is the Relcom staff member
responsible for netnews -- contact him for more information.

vmsnet
------

This hierarchy is for topics of interest to VAX/VMS users (but not
necessarily VMS-specific). These groups are a project of the VMSnet working
group of the VAX SIG of the US Chapter of DECUS (the Digital Equipment
Computer User's Society). They are carried by most major usenet news sites,
and almost half of all netnews sites. To find a feed, contact the system
managers of news sites near you, and/or post to a local or regional
newsgroup and ask if anyone in the area is carrying the VMSnet newsgroups.

If you have tried these alternatives and still can not find a site in your
local area that carries the VMSnet groups, you can send mail to the VMSnet
Network Coordinator, currently Charles T. Smith, Jr. <cts@dragon.com>, who
will attempt to assist you in finding a feed for the groups. Alternatively,
you can send mail to the VMSnet mailing list <vmsnet@drycas.club.cc.cmu.edu>,
which is also gatewayed to the vmsnet.uucp newsgroup and ask for help.

In either case, be sure to state where you are geographically, and what
your constraints are. For instance, if you can only place local phone
calls, be sure to say just what areas are a local call for you. Also
describe your network connectivity (what networks you are on, your uucp
neighbors, etc.).

Here is a recent list of VMSnet newsgroups. NOTE: this is NOT the
definitive list of VMSnet newsgroups. The current definitive list is always
