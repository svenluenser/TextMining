Mr Duncan,

As user of the Australian Bulletin Board Service community, I ______________
would like to express my concerns about the review of Section 4.2.2 of the
Basic Carriage Service tariff filed on July 1, 1995.

In light of Telstra's plans for the billing of community based public access
Bulletin Board Systems (B.B.S) there are grave fears within the free modeming
community that these systems will be forced to close down due to the
increased costs.  If Telstra are allowed to change the leasing rate for the
telephony lines of these FREE services then a great injustice will have been
done to the hobbyist systems that will be caught up in a procedure that can
only be described as bureaucratic box labelling.

Telstra does not know enough about the operations of such services at this
time and should not be considered competent to be able to make decisions
about the status of purely amateur, non-profit Bulletin Board Systems.

Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity, as a user of these
community service and hobbyist based systems, to insist that the relevant
section of the Basic Carriage Service be reviewed in accordance with stricter
guidelines for the definition of the type of online service that constitutes
a "business".


                                                        Yours sincerely,


                                                            {Signature}
