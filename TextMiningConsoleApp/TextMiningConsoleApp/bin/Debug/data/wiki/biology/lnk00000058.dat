  The Respiratory System and Gas Exchange | Back to Top

   Cellular respiration involves the breakdown of organic molecules to produce ATP. A sufficient
   supply of oxygen is required for the aerobic respiratory machinery of Kreb's Cycle and the
   Electron Transport System to efficiently convert stored organic energy into energy trapped in
   ATP. Carbon dioxide is also generated by cellular metabolism and must be removed from the cell.
   There must be an exchange of gases: carbon dioxide leaving the cell, oxygen entering. Animals
   have organ systems involved in facilitating this exchange as well as the transport of gases to
   and from exchange areas.

  Bodies and Respiration | Back to Top

   Single-celled organisms exchange gases directly across their cell membrane. However, the slow
   diffusion rate of oxygen relative to carbon dioxide limits the size of single-celled organisms.
   Simple animals that lack specialized exchange surfaces have flattened, tubular, or thin shaped
   body plans, which are the most efficient for gas exchange. However, these simple animals are
   rather small in size.

  Respiratory Surfaces | Back to Top

   Large animals cannot maintain gas exchange by diffusion across their outer surface. They
   developed a variety of respiratory surfaces that all increase the surface area for exchange,
   thus allowing for larger bodies. A respiratory surface is covered with thin, moist epithelial
   cells that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to exchange. Those gases can only cross cell
   membranes when they are dissolved in water or an aqueous solution, thus respiratory surfaces
   must be moist.

  Methods of Respiration | Back to Top

   Sponges and jellyfish lack specialized organs for gas exchange and take in gases directly from
   the surrounding water. Flatworms and annelids use their outer surfaces as gas exchange surfaces.
   Arthropods, annelids, and fish use gills; terrestrial vertebrates utilize internal lungs.

    The Body Surface

   Flatworms and annelids use their outer surfaces as gas exchange surfaces. Earthworms have a
   series of thin-walled blood vessels known as capillaries. Gas exchange occurs at capillaries
   located throughout the body as well as those in the respiratory surface.

   Amphibians use their skin as a respiratory surface. Frogs eliminate carbon dioxide 2.5 times as
   fast through their skin as they do through their lungs. Eels (a fish) obtain 60% of their oxygen
   through their skin. Humans exchange only 1% of their carbon dioxide through their skin.
   Constraints of water loss dictate that terrestrial animals must develop more efficient lungs.

    Gills

   Gills greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange. They occur in a variety of animal
   groups including arthropods (including some terrestrial crustaceans), annelids, fish, and
   amphibians. Gills typically are convoluted outgrowths containing blood vessels covered by a thin
   epithelial layer. Typically gills are organized into a series of plates and may be internal (as
   in crabs and fish) or external to the body (as in some amphibians).

   Gills are very efficient at removing oxygen from water: there is only 1/20 the amount of oxygen
   present in water as in the same volume of air. Water flows over gills in one direction while
   blood flows in the opposite direction through gill capillaries. This countercurrent flow
   maximizes oxygen transfer.

    Tracheal Systems

   Many terrestrial animals have their respiratory surfaces inside the body and connected to the
   outside by a series of tubes.Tracheae are these tubes that carry air directly to cells for gas
   exchange. Spiracles are openings at the body surface that lead to tracheae that branch into
   smaller tubes known as tracheoles. Body movements or contractions speed up the rate of diffusion
   of gases from tracheae into body cells. However, tracheae will not function well in animals
   whose body is longer than 5 cm.

    Lungs

   Lungs are ingrowths of the body wall and connect to the outside by as series of tubes and small
   openings. Lung breathing probably evolved about 400 million years ago. Lungs are not entirely
   the sole property of vertebrates, some terrestrial snails have a gas exchange structures similar
   to those in frogs.

  Respiratory System Principles | Back to Top

    1. Movement of an oxygen-containing medium so it contacts a moist membrane overlying blood
       vessels.
    2. Diffusion of oxygen from the medium into the blood.
    3. Transport of oxygen to the tissues and cells of the body.
    4. Diffusion of oxygen from the blood into cells.
    5. Carbon dioxide follows a reverse path.

  The Human Respiratory System | Back to Top

   This system includes the lungs, pathways connecting them to the outside environment, and
   structures in the chest involved with moving air in and out of the lungs.

   Air enters the body through the nose, is warmed, filtered, and passed through the nasal cavity.
   Air passes the pharynx (which has the epiglottis that prevents food from entering the
   trachea).The upper part of the trachea contains the larynx. The vocal cords are two bands of
   tissue that extend across the opening of the larynx. After passing the larynx, the air moves
   into the bronchi that carry air in and out of the lungs.

   Bronchi are reinforced to prevent their collapse and are lined with ciliated epithelium and
   mucus-producing cells. Bronchi branch into smaller and smaller tubes known as bronchioles.
   Bronchioles terminate in grape-like sac clusters known as alveoli. Alveoli are surrounded by a
   network of thin-walled capillaries. Only about 0.2 Âµm separate the alveoli from the capillaries
   due to the extremely thin walls of both structures.

   The lungs are large, lobed, paired organs in the chest (also known as the thoracic cavity). Thin
   sheets of epithelium (pleura) separate the inside of the chest cavity from the outer surface of
   the lungs. The bottom of the thoracic cavity is formed by the diaphragm.

   Ventilation is the mechanics of breathing in and out. When you inhale, muscles in the chest wall
   contract, lifting the ribs and pulling them, outward. The diaphragm at this time moves downward
   enlarging the chest cavity. Reduced air pressure in the lungs causes air to enter the lungs.
   Exhaling reverses theses steps.

  Diseases of the Respiratory System | Back to Top

   The condition of the airways and the pressure difference between the lungs and atmosphere are
   important factors in the flow of air in and out of lungs. Many diseases affect the condition of
   the airways.
     * Asthma narrows the airways by causing an allergy-induced spasms of surrounding muscles or by
       clogging the airways with mucus.
     * Bronchitis is an inflammatory response that reduces airflow and is caused by long-term
       exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke, air pollutants, or allergens.
     * Cystic fibrosis is a genetic defect that causes excessive mucus production that clogs the
       airways.

  The Alveoli and Gas Exchange | Back to Top

   Diffusion is the movement of materials from a higher to a lower concentration. The differences
   between oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations are measured by partial pressures. The greater
   the difference in partial pressure the greater the rate of diffusion.

   Respiratory pigments increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Humans have the
   red-colored pigment hemoglobin as their respiratory pigment. Hemoglobin increases the
   oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood between 65 and 70 times. Each red blood cell has about 250
   million hemoglobin molecules, and each milliliter of blood contains 1.25 X 10^15 hemoglobin
   molecules. Oxygen concentration in cells is low (when leaving the lungs blood is 97% saturated
   with oxygen), so oxygen diffuses from the blood to the cells when it reaches the capillaries.

   Carbon dioxide concentration in metabolically active cells is much greater than in capillaries,
   so carbon dioxide diffuses from the cells into the capillaries. Water in the blood combines with
   carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate. This removes the carbon dioxide from the blood so diffusion
   of even more carbon dioxide from the cells into the capillaries continues yet still manages to
   "package" the carbon dioxide for eventual passage out of the body.

   In the alveoli capillaries, bicarbonate combines with a hydrogen ion (proton) to form carbonic
   acid, which breaks down into carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide then diffuses into the
   alveoli and out of the body with the next exhalation.

  Control of Respiration | Back to Top

   Muscular contraction and relaxation controls the rate of expansion and constriction of the
   lungs. These muscles are stimulated by nerves that carry messages from the part of the brain
   that controls breathing, the medulla. Two systems control breathing: an automatic response and a
   voluntary response. Both are involved in holding your breath.

   Although the automatic breathing regulation system allows you to breathe while you sleep, it
   sometimes malfunctions. Apnea involves stoppage of breathing for as long as 10 seconds, in some
   individuals as often as 300 times per night. This failure to respond to elevated blood levels of
   carbon dioxide may result from viral infections of the brain, tumors, or it may develop
   spontaneously. A malfunction of the breathing centers in newborns may result in SIDS (sudden
   infant death syndrome).

   As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. Above 10,000 feet decreased oxygen
   pressures causes loading of oxygen into hemoglobin to drop off, leading to lowered oxygen levels
   in the blood. The result can be mountain sickness (nausea and loss of appetite). Mountain
   sickness does not result from oxygen starvation but rather from the loss of carbon dioxide due
   to increased breathing in order to obtain more oxygen.
