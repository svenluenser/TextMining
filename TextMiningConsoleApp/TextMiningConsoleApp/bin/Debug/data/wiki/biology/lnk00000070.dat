  Evolution of Eukaryotes | Back to Top

   The transition to eukaryotic cells appears to have occurred during the Proterozoic Era, about
   1.2 to 1.5 billion years ago. However, recent genetic studies suggest eukaryotes diverged from
   prokaryotes closer to 2 billion years ago. Fossils do not yet agree with this date. The old
   Kingdom Protista, as I learned it long ago, thus contains some living groups that might serve as
   possible models for the early eukaryotes. This taxonomic kingdom has been broken into many new
   kingdoms, reflecting new studies and techniques that help elucidate the true phylogenetic
   sequence of life on Earth.

   Protists exhibit a great deal of variation in their life histories (life cycles). They exhibit
   an alternation between diploid and haploid phases that is similar to the alternation of
   generations found in plants. Protist life cycles vary from diploid dominant, to haploid
   dominant. A generalized eukaryote life cycle is shown in Figure 1.

   The great diversity of form, habitat, mode of nutrition, and life history exhibited by
   eukaryotes suggests they evolved several times from various groups of prokaryotes. This makes
   the Protista a polyphyletic group. Eukaryotes are generally larger, have a variety of
   membrane-bound organelles, greater internal complexity than prokaryotic cells, and has a
   secialized method of cell division (meiosis) that is a prelude to true sexual reproduction.
   Protists might be viewed as a group from which the other eukaryotic kingdoms evolved, as shown
   by Figure 2.

  Eukaryotic Organelles and Prokaryotic Symbionts | Back to Top

   Symbiosis is the interactive association of two or more species living together. There are
   several types of symbiosis. Parasitism is a symbiosis where one organism causes harm to the
   other, its host. An example of this is a disease causing bacterium, such as Treponema pallidum,
   which causes the disease syphilis in humans. Commensalism is a symbiosis where one organism
   benefits and the other is not harmed or helped. The symbiotic relationship between alge and
   fungi in lichens is an example of this. Mutualism is a symbiosis where both organisms benefit.
   Mutualism examples are abundant: zooxanthellae are dinoflagellates that live within the body of
   coral; E. coli bacteria live in the human intestine; etc.

   The symbiotic model proposed by American biologist Lynn Margulis suggests possible symbiosis of
   bacteria within early eukaryotic cells. Margulis proposed the mechanism of endosymbiosis, shown
   in Figure 3, to explain the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts from permanent resident
   prokaryotes. According to this idea, a larger prokaryote (or perhaps early eukaryote) engulfed
   or surrounded a smaller prokaryote some 1.5 billion to 700 million years ago.

   Figure 3. Hypothesized steps in the endosymbiosis of bacteria to produce mitochondria and/or
   chloroplasts. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer
   Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                           [endosymbio.gif]

   Instead of digesting the smaller organisms the large one and the smaller one entered into a type
   of symbiosis known as mutualism, where both organisms benefit and neither is harmed. The larger
   organism gained excess ATP provided by the "protomitochondrion" and excess sugar provided by the
   "protochloroplast", while providing a stable environment and the raw materials the endosymbionts
   required. This has become so strong a symbiosis that eukaryotic cells cannot survive without
   their mitochondria (likewise photosynthetic eukaryotes cannot survive without their
   chloroplasts), and the endosymbionts cannot survive outside their hosts. Nearly all (but not
   ALL) eukaryotes have mitochondria. Mitochondrial division is remarkably similar to the
   prokaryotic methods that were studied in the cell division and bacterial diversity chapters.

   Chloroplasts and mitochondria still retain their own DNA, and have the diversity of structure
   and photosynthetic pigments that supports the idea that the endosymbiosis events occurred
   independantly several times. The photosynthetic pigments (see Table 1) in the red, brown,
   golden-brown, and green algae are very different, lending support for the hypothesis of several
   different, independent endosymbiotic events.

   Table 1. Photosynthetic pigments of monerans, algae, and plants. Prokaryote groups are shown in
   red, protists in blue, and vascular plants in purple.

   Vascular Plants

                                   chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids

   The DNA, ribosomes, biochemistry, and reproduction of chloroplasts and mitochondria are
   remarkably bacteria-like. Some living eukaryotes, such as the "amoeba" Pelomyxa (also known as
   Chaos), lack mitochondria, having instead endosymbiotic bacteria that perform mitochondrial
   duties of ATP generation.

  Classification of Protists | Back to Top

   The protists include heterotrophs, autotrophs, and some organisms that can vary their
   nutritional mode depending on environmental conditions. Protists occur in freshwater, saltwater,
   soil, and as symbionts within other organisms. Due to this tremendous diversity, classification
   of the Protista is difficult.

   Historically the group has been subdivied based on the mode of nutrition, photosynthestic
   pigments, and the type of organelles used for locomotion. For example, the organisms using cilia
   to propel themselves were all placed in the Phylum Ciliata; those using pseudopodia were all in
   the Phylum Sarcodina. This is an example of form classification, and worked well enough until
   scientists began to examine the protists both biochemically and ultratsructurally (with electron
   microscopes). They discovered the form classification mentioned above did not support the
   existence of monophyletic groups, and thus should be abandoned. Several new kingdoms have been
   proposed for the old protista, although consensus amongst systematists working with these groups
   has yet to fully emerge. Several organisms once placed in the protists have been moved to other
   Kingdoms, while others have moved from the Kingdom Fungi to the protists.

  Kingdom Archaezoa | Back to Top

   Organisms placed in this proposed kingdom lack mitochondria. Scientists interpret this as an
   indication of the divergence of this group from other "protists" prior to the endosymbiosis
   event that led to the development of the mitochondrion. However, some recent studies seem to
   indicate that some of the organisms placed in this group are secondarily mitochondrialess: their
   ancestors had mitochondria but lost them over time. This casts doubt on the monophyletic nature
   of this proposed kingdom.

   Members of the diplomonad subgroup of archaezoans have two flagella, two nuclei, and no
   mitochondria. Giardia lamblia, an intestinal parasite that causes giardiasis, is a member of
   this group. A colorized scanning electron migrograph of this organism is shown in Figure 4.

  Kingdom Euglenozoa | Back to Top

   This proposed kingdom includes protists with one or two flagella emerging from an anterior
   pocket, and paramylum (a glucose polymer) as the storage product for sugars. Some members of
   this group are are autotrophic, while others are heterotrophic.

    Phylum Euglenophyta

   Organisms in the Euglenophyta have two flagella, a contractile vacuole, a photoreceptive
   eyespot, several chloroplasts, lack a cell wall, and can live as either autotrophs or
   heterotrophs. Some autotrophic species of Euglena, such as the one shown in Figure 5, become
   heterotrophic when light levels are low. Their chloroplasts are surrounded by three rather than
   the more typical two membranes. Euglenoid chloroplasts resemble those of green algae, and are
   probably derived from the green algae through endosymbiosis. However, the euglenoid pyrenoid
   produces an unusual type of carbohydrate polymer (paramylum) not seen in green algae.

   Figure 5. The structure of Euglena, a flagellated protistan. Image from Purves et al., Life: The
   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                            [euglena.gif]

   Euglenoids lack cell walls. In its place, however, is a flexible pellicle composed of protein
   strips side. Euglenoids also have a contractile vacuole, like many other protists, for
   eliminating excess water. Euglenoids reproduce by longitudinal cell division, and sexual
   reproduction is not known to occur.

    Phylum Kinetoplastida

   The other group within the Euglenozoa is the kinetoplastids. All members of this group are
   symbiotic, with some being parasitic. Trypanosoma is a kinetoplastid. Trypanosoma brucei is a
   trypanosome transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly; it is the cause of African sleeping
   sickness.

  Kingdom Alveolata | Back to Top

   The kingdom Alveolata was only recently recognized. The synapomorphy of this clade is the
   presence of small saccules (alveoli) below the cell membrane surface. Major groups in this
   kingdom are the ciliates, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans (a group of parasites that cause
   malaria and other diseases).

    Phylum Ciliophora

   The phylum Ciliophora contains about 8,000 species of ciliates. Ciliates move by coordinated
   strokes of hundreds of cilia projecting through tiny holes in a semirigid pellicle. They
   discharge long, barbed trichocysts for defense and for capturing prey; toxicysts release a
   poison.

   Ciliates are complex, heterotrophic protozoans that lack cell walls and use multiple small cilia
   for locomotion. To increase strength of the cell boundary, ciliates have a pellicle, a sort of
   tougher membrane that still allows them to change shape. Most of the 8000 species are
   freshwater. Most ciliates have two nuclei: a macronucleus that contains hundreds of copies of
   the genome and controls metabolisms, and a single small micronucleus that contains a single copy
   of the genome and functions in sexual reproduction. Paramecium is a common ciliate seen by
   students in introductory biology classes, and is shown in Figures 6 and 7.

   Figure 6. Structure of Paramecium, a typical ciliate. Image from Purves et al., Life: The
   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   Since ciliates (an many freshwater protozoans) are hypotonic, removal of water crossing the cell
   membrane by osmosis is a significant problem. One commonly employed mechanism is a contractile
   vacuole, shown in Figure 8. Water is collected into the central ring of the vacuole and actively
   transported from the cell.

   Figure 8. Functioning of a contractile vacuole in Paramecium. Image from Purves et al., Life:
   The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                         [contractilevac.gif]

   Food is taken into the cell by an oral groove (or gullet, as shown in Figure 9), where small
   particles of the food are phagocytosed into food vacuoles. Often this can be accomplished in the
   laboratory period by using yeast stained with congo red dye, allowing students to see food
   vacuoles forming. The food vacuoles travel through the cytoplasm and are digested, with the
   molecules eventually passing into the cytoplasm, and wastes being expelled from the cell by
   exocytosis.

                                          [paramecvacs.gif]

   Ciliates travel along a spiral path, as shown in Figure 10., with the cell rotating along its
   long axis and the direction of travel resembling a sine wave.

                                            [paramove.gif]

   During asexual reproduction, ciliates divide by transverse binary fission, as shown in Figure
   11. You may recall that bacteria have a somewhat similar type of binary fission, although no
   nuclei occur in bacteria.

   Figure 11. Binary fission in Paramecium. Image from
   http://biodidac.bio.uottawa.ca/thumbnails/filedet.htm?File_name=OLIH023P&File_type=GIF.

                                           [1-OLIH023P.GIF]

   Ciliates possess two types of nuclei---a large macronucleus and one or more small micronuclei.
   The macronucleus controls the normal metabolism of the cell. The micronucleus are involved in
   sexual reproduction in a process known as conjugation that is shown in Figure 12. The
   macronucleus disintegrates and the micronucleus undergoes meiosis. Two ciliates then exchange a
   haploid micronucleus.The micronuclei give rise to a new macronucleus containing certain
   housekeeping genes.

                                           [1-OLIH020P.GIF]

   Paramecium is by no means the only ciliate, merely one of the most common ones students will
   encounter during a laboratory session. Other ciliates include:
     * Blepharisma, shown with other ciliates in Figure 13, is a ciloiate very similar to, but
       slower than, Paramecium.
     * Stentor, a ciliate that resembles a giant blue vase with stripes.
     * Vorticella, a stalked ciliate bearing a ring of cilia at its "mouth".

    Phylum Pyrrophyta

   The phylum Pyrrophyta contains about 1,000 species of dinoflagellates, two members of which are
   shown in Figure 14. Members of this group have cell walls and store excess sugar as starch.
   These organisms are surrounded by protective cellulose plates. Some dinoflagellates also are
   "armored", having numerous plates that cover the cell. Ornamentation on these plates can be
   quite beautiful.

   Most dinoflagellates have two flagella; one lies in a longitudinal groove and acts as a rudder,
   the other is located within a transverse groove and its beating causes the cell to spin as it
   moves forward.

   Peridinium sp. (SEM x3,500). This image is copyright Dennis Kunkel at www.DennisKunkel.com, used

   [84145c.jpg]

   Most dinoflagellates are autotropic, having chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c in their chloroplasts,
   as well as a unique pigment peridinin, and some carotenoid pigments. Not all dinoflagellates are
   authotrophs, some are heterotrophic. Dinoflagellates can be extremely numerous, with
   concentrations being measured up to 30,000 individuals per cubic millimeter. Dinoflagellates are
   therefore an important source of food in certain ecosystems.

   Certain dinoflagellates live symbiotically inside corals, and are known as zooxanthellae. The
   coral animal provides a sheltered space, while the dinoflagellate provides food and oxygen to
   its host. Zoxanthellae are the small golden brown "dots" in the coral animals pictured in Figure
   15.

   Figure 15. Zooxanthellae in a coral. Image from
   http://www.biology.lsa.umich.edu/courses/bio255/zooxanthellae.jpg

                                        [01-zooxanthellae.jpg]

   Cell division in dinoflagellates differs from most protistans, with chromosomes attaching to the
   nuclear envelope and being pulled apart as the nuclear envelope stretches. During cell division
   in most other eukaryotes, the nuclear envelope dissolves during Prophase and reforms during
   Telophase.

   Red tides are oceanic phenomena caused by population explosions of certain types of
   dinoflagellates that release a neurotoxin into the environment after they die. Shellfish
   concentrate this toxin into a high enough dose that it can kill people who have eaten the
   contaminated shellfish. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute maintains a nice page describing What
   are Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs)?

   Figure 16. Top: Red tides are population explosions (or blooms) of dinoflagellates. This image
   is from http://www.redtide.whoi.edu/hab/rtphotos/noctiluca.jpg; Bottom: The dinoflagellates from
   this bloom. Image is from http://www.redtide.whoi.edu/hab/rtphotos/dinophysis.jpg.

                                           [noctiluca.jpg]

   [dinophysis.jpg]

   Fish kills have been linked to the dinoflagellate Pfiesteria. This organism does not release
   neurotoxins into the environment ala a red tide, but rather seesm to swarm onto fish. The
   lesions thus formed by the predation by the plethora of attacking Pfiesteria, result in the
   death of the fish. In certain areas of the U.S. east coast outbreaks of this organism (and other
   related forms) have resulted in mass fish kills.

   The fossil record of dinoflagellates is excellent, with most palynologists accepting fossils
   from the Triassic as representing some stage of the dinoflagellate life history. The oldest
   fossil that might be a dinoflagellate cyst is Arpylorus antiquus, from the Silurian-aged rocks.
   A group of microfossils that may in part be dinoflagellate cysts are the hystrichospherids, some
   of which date from the precambrian. Acritarchs, an abundant group of precambrian and Paleozoic
   microfossils, may also in part be dinoflagellates or might also represent some other group of
   algae.

    Phylum Apicomplexa

   This group consists of parasitic organisms united by their possession of a unique apical complex
   of microtubules. Many of the organisms now placed in this group were classified in the old
   Phylum Sporozoa. As a group, they have complex life cycles with diverse forms at different
   stages.

   Members of this group cause malaria and toxoplasmosis. The life history of each organism has it
   infecting a different host for part of its growth. Toxoplasmosis is transmitted from cats to
   humans, with between 7 and 72% of the population infected, depending on the geographic area.

   Malaria is a disease that effects an estimated 300 million people woreldwide. Therer are several
   organisms that cause malaria. most of which are spread by mosquitoes, transfusions, and shared
   hypodermic needles. Control of mosquito populations has led to declines in malaria in many
   areas. Infected individuals can be treated with a variety of medicines. However, some of the
   organisms that cause malaria heve developed immunity to some of the more commonly employed
   medicines.

   Plasmodium vivax, the cause of one type of malaria., is the most widespread human parasite. If a
   person is bitten by a female Anopheles mosquito, the parasite eventually invades the person's
   red blood cells, as shown in Figure 17. Chills and fever appear when red blood cells burst and
   release toxin into the person's blood.

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   [plasmodium_3.gif]

    Phylum Sarcodina: Amoebae

   The amoeboids are in the phylum Sarcodina, which includes approximately 40,000 species. They
   engulf their prey with pseudopods, cytoplasmic extensions formed as cytoplasm streams in one
   direction. Traditional;ly this group has included the amoebas, foraminifera, and radiolaria;
   some of which have been removed to other groups due to recent studies.

   Many amoeboids have shells, as do the foraminifera and radiolaria. Amoeba proteus, shown in
   Figure 18, is a commonly studied member. When amoeboids feed, they phagocytize their food; the
   pseudopods surround and engulf a prey item. Digestion then occurs within a food vacuole.
   Freshwater amoeboids, including Amoeba proteus, have contractile vacuoles used to eliminate
   excess water.

   Entamoeba hystolitica is an intestinal parasite in humans that causes amoebic dysentery (also
   known as Montezuma's Revenge or the Aztec Two-step). It is present in the water supply of many
   communities in Mexico (and other countries), and unless specifically filtered, toxins from this
   amoeba will cause a disease that can ruin a vacation. Over time, your body will acclimate to the
   toxins, but since many of us only are exposed for short times, our bodies will not be able to
   cope. Drinking filtered water should prevent contacting this illness. The Bad Bug Book website
   has a description of this illness.

   Amoeba moves by extensions of their cytoplasm known as pseudopodia. Pseudopodia, shown in Figure
   18, are used by many cells, and are not fixed structures like flagella but rather are associated
   with actin near the moving edge of the cytoplasm.

   Figure 18. Formation of pseudopodium by an amoeba. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science
   of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   Foraminifera (forams) are protists that live in the oceans and secrete a shell (also known as a
   test) composed of silica or calcium carbonate. The cytoplasm of formals extends out from under
   the shell. Thus, the fossil record of forams is quite good. Oxygen isotope data from forams has
   been used to calculate ocean temperature fluctuations over the past 100,000 years.

  Algae | Back to Top

   Algae are a polyphyletic group (therefore lacking any formal taxonomic validity, but still a
   useful term) that includes several smaller monophytletic groups. The fossil record of algae
   dates to the precambrian time (possible algae have been recovered from the Bitter Springs
   Formation rocks dated to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion years old), with undeniable algae appearing
   during the Paleozoic Era, by about 500 million years ago.

   Most algae use photosynthesis at least part of the time. Algae are subdivided by their type of
   wall, photosynthetic pigments, and method of food storage. Photosynthetic pigments and storage
   of sugars are quite diverse within the algae. Algae are major components of the phytoplankton,
   an important source of oxygen and the base of many food webs in the oceans and freshwater. Body
   styles range from single-celled to colonial (possibly simple multicellular).

  Kingdom Stramenopila | Back to Top

   This proposed kingdom includes the diatoms, golden algae, brown algae, and water molds. All
   members of this kingdom have numerous hair-like projections from their flagellae. The
   monophyletic nature of this group has been established by molecular systematic methods. When
   they are photosynthetic, chlorophyll c is the main accessory pigment. This kingdom includes
   diatoms, giant kelps, and mildews, making it a very diverse group both in terms of lifestyle as
   well as the size iof organisms.

    Phylum Chrysophyta

   This group of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial algae includes the golden algae. Although most
   members of this group are autotrophs, the vast majority of them can become heterotrophs when
   light levels are low. Food is stored as oils, and photosynthetic pigments include chlorophyll a
   and c and yellow carotenoid pigments.

   This phylum includes several distinct groups, some of which may be removed to other phyla in the
   future, such as the silicoflagellates and yellow-green algae.

    Phylum Bacillarophyta: Diatoms live in glass houses

   Some classifications include this phylum in the chrysophytes. Diatoms are the most numerous
   unicellular algae in the oceans. They are extremely numerous and an important source of food and
   O[2] for heterotrophs in aquatic systems. Examples of the various types of diatoms are shown in
   Figure 20. Diatoms have a cell wall comnprised of two halves technically referred to as valves.
   These valves are mostly made of silica (SiO[2]). The diatom cell wall is perforated by numerous
   small openings. When diatoms reproduce asexually, each received one old valve. The new valve
   fits inside the old one; therefore, the new diatom is smaller than the original one. Once the
   shells reach a certain size the diatom reproduces sexually and restores its size, allowing the
   asexual reproduction cycle to begin anew.

   Diatoms secrete a silicon dioxide shell (called a frustule) that forms the fossil deposits known
   as diatomaceous earth, which is used in filters and as abrasives in polishing compounds. Diatoms
   divide into two groups,the pennaleans with bilateral symmetry and elongated shape, and another,
   the centraleans, with radial symmetry and a rotund shape. Certain diatoms also are important
   indicators of water quality, while others are useful fossils for age-dating Quaternary deposits.

    Phylum Phaeophyta: the Brown Algae

   The phylum Phaeophyta, commonly referred to as the brown algae, are a group that is entirely
   multicellular. All of its members also have the accessory pigment fucoxanthin (a brown pigment
   that gives the group its name) and stored sugar as the carbohydrate laminarin. The chloroplasts
   contain both chlorophylls a and c . Members of the group include the giant kelp that can be over
   100 meters long. Brown algae are used in foods, animal feeds, and fertilizers and as a source
   for alginate, a chemical emulsifier added to ice cream, salad dressing, and candy. Brown algae
   also provide food and habitat for marine organisms, as witnessed by the great biodiversity found
   among the kelp "forests" off the California coast.

   Fucus is a brown alga differentiated into a floating "blade", flotation bladder, stalk (or
   stipe) and basal holdfast. Sargassum, common in the Sargasso Sea region of the Atlantic Ocean,
   floats and maintains position by a flotation bladder filled with gas. Laminaria is a kelp found
   in the intertidal zone. It is unique among protists because it has tissue differentiation.

    Phylum Oomycota: the Water Molds

   The phylum Oomycota includes the water molds with about 580 species. As indicated by the name,
   once this group was considered to belong to the fungi. Aquatic water molds parasitize fishes,
   forming furry growths on their gills. Some terrestrial water molds parasitize insects and
   plants; water mold was responsible for Irish potato famine. The body of water molds is
   filamentous, although cell walls are largely composed of cellulose (fungi have chitin in their
   cell walls). During asexual reproduction, they produce diploid motile spores (2n zoospores; most
   fungi lack motile spores). Unlike fungi, the adult phase of the life cycle is diploid, producing
   gametes by meiosis. Eggs are produced in enlarged structures known as oogonia.

      The Irish Problem

   The Irish potato famine was a terrible disaster caused by a water mold, Phytophthora infestans.
   This scourge is an example of the impact that a disease can have on the political, economic and
   social structure of several countries. The potato is a crop imported from South America. The
   potato was planted in Ireland, and the population of Ireland exploded from 4.5 million in 1800
   to about 8 million in 1845. Most of the Irish were dependent on the potato for their food for
   ten months of the year. The late blight of potato thus had a very serious consequence to the
   Irish: famine and starvation. Between 1845 and 1860 over one million Irish died as a result of
   the famine brought about by the blight. During the same timespan, another 1.5 million emigrated,
   mostly to the east coast of the United States. Among immigrants during this time were ancestors
   of Presidents Kennedy and Reagan, among many others.

  Kingdom Rhodophyta, the Red Algae

   The red algae are placed in their own kingdom, the Rhodophyta, consisting of about 4,000
   species. They are chiefly marine, multicellular organisms that are, as a rule, smaller and more
   delicate that the brown algae. Some are filamentous, but most are branched, having a feathery,
   flat, or ribbonlike appearance. Sexual reproduction involves oogamy, although the sperm are not
   flagellated. The food reserve is floridean starch, a polysaccharide that resembles glycogen.

   Red algae have large amounts of the red pigment phycoerythrin (seen in Figure 22), and range
   from unicellular to multicellular in their body plans (sometimes attaining greater than one
   meter in length). Red algae are thought to have originated by symbiosis of cyanobacteria (which
   also have phycoerythrin).

   Some red algae, the coralline algae, are important contributors to tropical reefs. Mucilaginous
   material in cell walls is source of agar used to make drug capsules, dental impressions, and
   cosmetics. Agar is also a major microbiological media, and when purified, is a gel for
   electrophoresis. Agar is also used in food preparation to keep baked goods from drying and to
   set jellies, and desserts. Carrageenan is an additive to puddings and ice creams; dried sheets
   of red algae are used in some Japanese dishes.

    Chlorophyta, the "Green Algae"

   What I grew up referring to as the green algae is not a real taxonomic group: it is a
   paraphyletic group in need to separation. There seem to be two main lineages within the
   traditional green algae, and these may turn out to make good monophyletic groups in future
   systematic revisions of the green algae. Some of the traditional green algae should remain in
   the Chlorophyta, while others that are allied with plants should be removed to the Plant
   Kingdom. Pending such a revision, I will present the green algae as if they were in fact
   monophyletic, but with full realization they are not. Confused? Me too!

   Green algae have cellulose cell walls, both chlorophylls a and b, and store excess sugar as
   starch. Some mebers of this group have been considered the undoubted ancestors of plants. Not
   all members of this group are allied to the plants, however. Body types in the green algae
   include unicellular to colonial as well as simple multicelluar. We will examine several of these
   representative groups.

   Chlamydomonas, shown in Figure 23, and similar cells appear to be a starting point within this
   group. Autotrophic, unicellular forms with a single, cup-shaped chloroplast and two apically
   inserted flagella, these small cells also possess a contractile vacuole and pyrenoid. Excess
   sugars are stored as starch surrounding the pyrenoid.

   Figure 23. Chlamydomonas, a unicelled, biflagellated green alga. This image is from
   http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/protists/chlamy/chlamy21.lab.gif.

                                          [chlamy21.lab.gif]

   Chlamydomonas reproduces sexually when growth conditions are unfavorable, a common process
   employed by many protists to withstand or outlast a deteriorating environment. Gametes from two
   different mating types (since this organism is typically isogamous we cannot use the terms male
   and female) come into contact and join to form a diploid zygote. A heavy wall forms around the
   zygote, in effect turning the diploid zygote into a resistant zygospore that can survive until
   conditions become favorable once again.

   Multicellular green algae have some division of labor, producing various reproductive cells and
   structures. Ulva, the sea lettuce illyustrated in Figure 24, exhibits alternation of
   generations, producing free-living gametophyte and sporophyte forms. The common sea lettuce is
   usually haploid (the gametophyte) and reproduces asexually. Gametes are produced by mitosis,
   fuse, and produce a diploid zygote. The 2n zygote germinates and grows to become the sporophyte.
   Meiosis occurs in certain of the cells in the sporophyte, producing haploid swimming spores that
   will settle to the ocean floor and produce the next generation haploid gametophyte stage.

   Figure 24. Life cycle of Ulva, a multicelled green alga. Image from Purves et al., Life: The
   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                          [grnalgaelc_1.gif]

   Filametous algae produce gametes by mitosis within one cell of the filament. Reproduction of
   this type of green algae is shown in Figure 25. These gametes are released, fuse to form a
   diploid zygote that soon undergoes meiosis to produce hapoid zoospores that swim, rest on the
   sea floor and develop into the next generation gametophyte phase.

   [grnalgafillc_2.gif]

   A Volvox colony is an example of a colonial algae. Each Volvox is a hollow sphere with thousands
   of cells arranged in a single layer on its perimeter. Individual Volvox cells resemble a
   Chlamydomonas cell. A new colony arises as if daughter cells fail to separate.


  Slime Molds: Myxomycota

   Slime molds are often classified as fungi, although now most specialists consider them a group
   of protistans. In fact, slime molds do not forma monophyletic group, and will have to be
   subdivided in some future classification scheme. Slime molds are not closely related to other
   groups of plants or animals. Slime molds, which spend part of their life as single-celled forms,
   can aggregate to form multicellular forms. They thus may represent a transition between
   unicellular and multicelluar forms, the second major advancement after the evolution of
   eukaryotic cells. Figure 26 illustrates some of the stages of a plasmodial life history.

The Fossil Record | Back to Top

   The first protist fossils occur in rocks approximately 1.2-1.4 billion years old from the Bitter
   Springs Formation in Australia. However, some paleobiologists doubt that these small (a mere 5
   micrometers in diameter) cells are actually eukaryotic. An older group of eukaryotic
   microfossils (perhaps dating back as far as 1.8 billion years ago) are the acritarchs. Many
   "algae" produce resting cysts that resemble acritarchs. Multicellular protists appeared in the
   fossil record more than 600 million years ago. Some problemmatic fossils, thought by some
   paleobotanists to be algae, have been found in rocks approximately one billion years old.
