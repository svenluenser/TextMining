Glycolysis, the Universal Process | Back to Top

   Nine reactions, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme, makeup the process we call glycolysis. ALL
   organisms have glycolysis occurring in their cytoplasm.

   At steps 1 and 3 ATP is converted into ADP, inputting energy into the reaction as well as
   attaching a phosphate to the glucose. At steps 6 and 9 ADP is converted into the higher energy
   ATP. At step 5 NAD^+ is converted into NADH + H^+.

   The process works on glucose, a 6-C, until step 4 splits the 6-C into two 3-C compounds.
   Glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP, also known as phosphoglyceraldehyde, PGAL) is the more readily
   used of the two. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be converted into GAP by the enzyme Isomerase.
   The end of the glycolysis process yields two pyruvic acid (3-C) molecules, and a net gain of 2
   ATP and two NADH per glucose.

Anaerobic Pathways | Back to Top

   Under anaerobic conditions, the absence of oxygen, pyruvic acid can be routed by the organism
   into one of three pathways: lactic acid fermentation, alcohol fermentation, or cellular
   (anaerobic) respiration. Humans cannot ferment alcohol in their own bodies, we lack the genetic
   information to do so. These biochemical pathways, with their myriad reactions catalyzed by
   reaction-specific enzymes all under genetic control, are extremely complex. We will only skim
   the surface at this time and in this course.

   Alcohol fermentation is the formation of alcohol from sugar. Yeast, when under anaerobic
   conditions, convert glucose to pyruvic acid via the glycolysis pathways, then go one step
   farther, converting pyruvic acid into ethanol, a C-2 compound.

   Many organisms will also ferment pyruvic acid into, other chemicals, such as lactic acid. Humans
   ferment lactic acid in muscles where oxygen becomes depleted, resulting in localized anaerobic
   conditions. This lactic acid causes the muscle stiffness couch-potatoes feel after beginning
   exercise programs. The stiffness goes away after a few days since the cessation of strenuous
   activity allows aerobic conditions to return to the muscle, and the lactic acid can be converted
   into ATP via the normal aerobic respiration pathways.

Aerobic Respiration | Back to Top

   When oxygen is present (aerobic conditions), most organisms will undergo two more steps, Kreb's
   Cycle, and Electron Transport, to produce their ATP. In eukaryotes, these processes occur in the
   mitochondria, while in prokaryotes they occur in the cytoplasm.

  Acetyl Co-A: The Transition Reaction

   Pyruvic acid is first altered in the transition reaction by removal of a carbon and two oxygens
   (which form carbon dioxide). When the carbon dioxide is removed, energy is given off, and NAD+
   is converted into the higher energy form NADH. Coenzyme A attaches to the remaining 2-C (acetyl)
   unit, forming acetyl Co-A. This process is a prelude to the Kreb's Cycle.

  Kreb's Cycle (aka Citric Acid Cycle)

   The Acetyl Co-A (2-C) is attached to a 4-C chemical (oxaloacetic acid). The Co-A is released and
   returns to await another pyruvic acid. The 2-C and 4-C make another chemical known as Citric
   acid, a 6-C. Kreb's Cycle is also known as the Citric Acid Cycle. The process after Citric Acid
   is essentially removing carbon dioxide, getting out energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH and
   FADH[2], and lastly regenerating the cycle. Between Isocitric Acid and a-Ketoglutaric Acid,
   carbon dioxide is given off and NAD+ is converted into NADH. Between a-Ketoglutaric Acid and
   Succinic Acid the release of carbon dioxide and reduction of NAD^+ into NADH happens again,
   resulting in a 4-C chemical, succinic acid. GTP (Guanine Triphosphate, which transfers its
   energy to ATP) is also formed here (GTP is formed by attaching a phosphate to GDP).

   The remaining energy carrier-generating steps involve the shifting of atomic arrangements within
   the 4-C molecules. Between Succinic Acid and Fumaric Acid, the molecular shifting releases not
   enough energy to make ATP or NADH outright, but instead this energy is captured by a new energy
   carrier, Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is reduced by the addition of two H's to become
   FADH[2]. FADH[2] is not as rich an energy carrier as NADH, yielding less ATP than the latter.

   The last step, between Malic Acid and Oxaloacetic Acid reforms OA to complete the cycle. Energy
   is given off and trapped by the reduction of NAD^+ to NADH. The carbon dioxide released by cells
   is generated by the Kreb's Cycle, as are the energy carriers (NADH and FADH[2]) which play a
   role in the next step.

  Electron Transport Phosphorylation

   Whereas Kreb's Cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion, the Electron Transport System
   (ETS) chemicals are embedded in the membranes known as the cristae. Kreb's cycle completely
   oxidized the carbons in the pyruvic acids, producing a small amount of ATP, and reducing NAD and
   FAD into higher energy forms. In the ETS those higher energy forms are cashed in, producing ATP.
   Cytochromes are molecules that pass the "hot potatoes" (electrons) along the ETS chain. Energy
   released by the "downhill" passage of electrons is captured as ATP by ADP molecules. The ADP is
   reduced by the gain of electrons. ATP formed in this way is made by the process of oxidative
   phosphorylation. The mechanism for the oxidative phosphorylation process is the gradient of H^+
   ions discovered across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This mechanism is known as chemiosmotic
   coupling. This involves both chemical and transport processes. Drops in the potential energy of
   electrons moving down the ETS chain occur at three points. These points turn out to be where ADP
   + P are converted into ATP. Potential energy is captured by ADP and stored in the pyrophosphate
   bond. NADH enters the ETS chain at the beginning, yielding 3 ATP per NADH. FADH[2] enters at
   Co-Q, producing only 2 ATP per FADH[2].
