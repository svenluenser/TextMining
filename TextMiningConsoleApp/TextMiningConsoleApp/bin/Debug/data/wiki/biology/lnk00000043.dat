  General Plant Organization | Back to Top

   A plant has two organ systems: 1) the shoot system, and 2) the root system. The shoot system is
   above ground and includes the organs such as leaves, buds, stems, flowers (if the plant has
   any), and fruits (if the plant has any). The root system includes those parts of the plant below
   ground, such as the roots, tubers, and rhizomes.

   Plant cells are formed at meristems, and then develop into cell types which are grouped into
   tissues. Plants have only three tissue types: 1) Dermal; 2) Ground; and 3) Vascular. Dermal
   tissue covers the outer surface of herbaceous plants. Dermal tissue is composed of epidermal
   cells, closely packed cells that secrete a waxy cuticle that aids in the prevention of water
   loss. The ground tissue comprises the bulk of the primary plant body. Parenchyma, collenchyma,
   and sclerenchyma cells are common in the ground tissue. Vascular tissue transports food, water,
   hormones and minerals within the plant. Vascular tissue includes xylem, phloem, parenchyma, and
   cambium cells.

   Plant cell types rise by mitosis from a meristem. A meristem may be defined as a region of
   localized mitosis. Meristems may be at the tip of the shoot or root (a type known as the apical
   meristem) or lateral, occurring in cylinders extending nearly the length of the plant. A cambium
   is a lateral meristem that produces (usually) secondary growth. Secondary growth produces both
   wood and cork (although from separate secondary meristems).

  Parenchyma | Back to Top

   A generalized plant cell type, parenchyma cells are alive at maturity. They function in storage,
   photosynthesis, and as the bulk of ground and vascular tissues. Palisade parenchyma cells are
   elogated cells located in many leaves just below the epidermal tissue. Spongy mesophyll cells
   occur below the one or two layers of palisade cells. Ray parenchyma cells occur in wood rays,
   the structures that transport materials laterally within a woody stem. Parenchyma cells also
   occur within the xylem and phloem of vascular bundles. The largest parenchyma cells occur in the
   pith region, often, as in corn (Zea ) stems, being larger than the vascular bundles. In many
   prepared slides they stain green.

  Collenchyma | Back to Top

   Collenchyma cells support the plant. These cells are charcterized by thickenings of the wall,
   the are alive at maturity. They tend to occur as part of vascular bundles or on the corners of
   angular stems. In many prepared slides they stain red.

  Sclerenchyma | Back to Top

   Sclerenchyma cells support the plant. They often occur as bundle cap fibers. Sclerenchyma cells
   are characterized by thickenings in their secondary walls. They are dead at maturity. They, like
   collenchyma, stain red in many commonly used prepared slides.

   A common type of schlerenchyma cell is the fiber.

   Some sclerenchyma cells occur in the fruits of Pear. These cells (sclereids or stone cells) give
   pears their gritty texture. View stone cells by clicking here.

  Xylem | Back to Top

   Xylem is a term applied to woody (lignin-impregnated) walls of certain cells of plants. Xylem
   cells tend to conduct water and minerals from roots to leaves. While parenchyma cells do occur
   within what is commonly termed the "xylem" the more identifiable cells, tracheids and vessel
   elements, tend to stain red with Safranin-O. Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell
   types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants. Tracheids are long and tapered, with angled
   end-plates that connect cell to cell. Vessel elements are shorter, much wider, and lack end
   plates. They occur only in angiosperms, the most recently evolved large group of plants.

   led.

   Tracheids, longer, and narrower than most vessels, appear first in the fossil record. Vessels
   occur later. Tracheids have obliquely-angled endwalls cut across by bars. The evolutionary trend
   in vessels is for shorter cells, with no bars on the endwalls.

   Phloem cells conduct food from leaves to rest of the plant. They are alive at maturity and tend
   to stain green (with the stain fast green). Phloem cells are usually located outside the xylem.
   The two most common cells in the phloem are the companion cells and sieve cells. Companion cells
   retain their nucleus and control the adjacent sieve cells. Dissolved food, as sucrose, flows
   through the sieve cells.

  Epidermal Cells | Back to Top

    Epidermis

   The epidermal tissue functions in prevention of water loss and acts as a barrier to fungi and
   other invaders. Thus, epidermal cells are closely packed, with little intercellular space. To
   further cut down on water loss, many plants have a waxy cuticle layer deposited on top of the
   epidermal cells.

    Guard Cells

   To facilitate gas exchange between the inner parts of leaves, stems, and fruits, plants have a
   series of openings known as stomata (singular stoma). Obviously these openings would allow gas
   exchange, but at a cost of water loss. Guard cells are bean-shaped cells covering the stomata
   opening. They regulate exchange of water vapor, oxygen and carbon dioxide through the stoma.
