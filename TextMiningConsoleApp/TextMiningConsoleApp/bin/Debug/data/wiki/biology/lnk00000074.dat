Organization of the Animal Body | Back to Top

   Animals are characteristically multicellular heterotrophs whose cells lack cell walls. At some
   point during their lives, animals are capable of movement. In the most commonly encountered
   animals, this stage is the adult, although some animals (corals) have sessile (nonmobile) adult
   phases and mobile juvenile forms. Animal and plant evolutionary history both show the
   development of multicellularity and the move from water to land (as well as secondary adaptation
   back to water).

   Animals developed external or internal skeletons to provide support, skin to prevent or lessen
   water loss, muscles that allowed them to move in search of food, brains and nervous systems for
   integration of stimuli, and internal digestive systems.

   Most animals have a life cycle with a preadult stage, a predominance of the diploid stage, and a
   series of embryonic developmental stages.

Evolution and Classification of Animals | Back to Top

   Animals probably evolved from marine protists, although no group of protists has been identified
   from an at-best sketchy fossil record for early animals. Cells in primitive animals (sponges in
   particular) show similarities to collared choanoflagellates as well as pseudopod-producing
   amoeboid cells.

   Multicellular animal fossils and burrows (presumably made by multicellular animals) first appear
   nearly 700 million years ago, during the late precambrian time (the part of the Proterozoic era
   termed the Vendian). All known Vendian animal fossils had soft body parts: no shells or hard
   (and hence preservable as fossils) parts. Learn more about these early animal fossils at
   Learning About the Vendian Animals. Animals in numerous phyla appear at (or in many cases
   before) the beginning of the Cambrian Period, as shown in Figure 1.

   Multicellular protists appeared in the fossil record more than 600 million years ago near the
   very end of the precambrian. This time is referred to as the Vendian Period (650 to 544 million
   years ago), and is characterized by the appearance of soft-bodied animal fossils, some of which
   are shown in Figure 2. Multicellular animal fossils and burrows (presumably made by unknown,
   soft-bodied multicellular animals) first appear 700 million years ago, during the Vendian time.
   All known Proterozoic animal fossils had soft body parts: no shells or hard (and hence
   preservable as fossils) parts. There are some paleontologists who suspect that the Vendian
   faunas were reduced by an extinction event, possibly related to massive glaciation, at the close
   of the vendian time. In any event, many animals in the Vendian assemblages are quite unlike
   anything living today, while others can be traced to extant phyla.

  The Cambrian: Animals with Hard Body Parts

   Beginning 570 million years ago, early during the Cambrian time, animals with external skeletons
   appeared in great abundance. This sudden appearance of fossils was used to define the beginning
   of the Cambrian (named after Cambria, an ancient name for the country of Wales). External
   skeletons were hard enough to be more readily preserved, leading to the apparent explosion of
   animals early in the Cambrian. Soft-bodied animals had dominated early animal evolution during
   an earlier time just prior to the Cambrian, the Vendian.

   Modern animals are classified into between 30 and 35 phyla: all major modern phyla were present
   at the beginning of the Cambrian, along with a great variety of now-extinct phyla recorded in
   the Burgess Shale (Cambrian) in Canada. Of the animal phyla, scientists consider nine major
   invertebrate phyla and the chordates to be of major importance in terms of biological diversity.
   While all major animal phyla are represented by Cambrian fossils, reconstructing fossil history
   is extremely difficult since earlier, soft-bodied animals did not fossilize well. Consequently,
   evolutionary relationships have been established for the most part on a studies of living
   (referred to as extant) animal anatomy.

Trends in Animal Evolution | Back to Top

   Within the animal kingdom several evolutionary trends and advancements are seen. Note that not
   all animal groups have all of the organs and organ systems found in the "higher animals", a fact
   consistent with stepwise evolutionary history . Nor will their body plans necessarily conform to
   ours.

  Body Plans

   Most animals have a body plan best described as a "tube-within-a-tube". This plan calls for two
   openings: one for food to enter the body (mouth), one for wastes to leave the body (anus). The
   tube-within-a-tube plan allows specialization of parts along the tube, such as a stomach,
   intestine, etc. The sac-like body plan has only one opening for both food intake and waste
   removal. Sac-like body plan animals do not have tissue specialization or development of organs.
   Animals with the "tube-within-a-tube" plan are 10% more efficient at digesting and absorbing
   their food than animals with the sac-like body plan.

  Triploblasty: Three Tissue Layers

   Many, but not all, animals produce three embryonic tissue tissue layers (shown in Table 1) as
   they develop: the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Some animals, most notably sponges, lack
   these tissue layers. Cnidarians (a group including coral and jellyfish) have only two of these
   layers, and are termed diploblastic. Flatworms, ribbon worms, humans, etc. have all three tissue
   layers, and are triploblastic.

  Asymmetry and Symmetry

   Asymmetrical animals (sponges, shown in Figure 4) have no general body plan or axis of symmetry
   that divides the body into mirror-image halves. Within the animal kingdom this appears to be a
   primitive condition. More advanced animals have symmetry. Radially symmetrical animals (such as
   coral and jelly fish, Figure 4) have body parts organized about a central axis, like the spokes
   in a bicycle wheel, with multiple planes of symmetry. Radially symmetrical animals are often,
   for some part of their life, nonmotile (termed in animals as sessile), and live attached to a
   substrate. Radial symmetry allows animals, such as jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones, to reach
   out in all directions from one central point. Bilaterally symmetrical animals (such as humans,
   Figure 3) have only a single plane of symmetry that produces mirror halves. Bilaterally
   symmetrical animals tend to be active and to move forward at an anterior end, which eventually
   led to concentration of sensory organs in the anterior end, or head (a trend known as
   cephalization).

   Figure 3. Different body plans. There are no planes of symmetry in the asymmetrical form, while
   the radial form has numerous planes. Bilateral organisms, like humans, have only one plane of
   symmetry, extending from the head to the toe. Bilateral symmetry is an important step in
   development of a head and concentration of sensory organs in that head. Image from Purves et
   al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH

  Body Cavity and Development

   Acoelomate animals (like flatworms and flukes, shown in Figure 4) do not have a coelom (or body
   cavity) produced during preadult development. Pseudocoelomate animals (such as roundworms) have
   a body cavity but it does not develop from splitting of the mesoderm embryonic tissue
   layer.Coelomate animals (humans, fish, shrimp, such as shown in Figure 4) have a body cavity
   lined with mesoderm cells.

   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   [cavities_3.gif]

    Protostome and Deuterostome

   Coelomates fall into either protostomes or deuterostomes, depending on how their embryos
   develop, as shown in Figure 5. Protostomes (from the Greek meaning literally "first mouth") are
   coelomates whose embryonic development makes a blastopore (the first opening in the blastula)
   that later develops into a mouth. Deuterostomes ("second mouth") are coelomates whose embryonic
   development produces a blastopore that later forms an anus, with a second opening forming the
   mouth (hence the designation of "second mouth"). Vertebrates are deuterostomes.

  Segmented Bodies

   Some animals have their bodies divided into segments, as shown in Figure 6. Segmentation allows
   them to specialize certain segments, such as for antennae, eyes, claws, etc. Humans, insects,
   and earthworms are examples of segmented animals. The systematic value of segmentation has been
   downplayed, with most specialists favoring segmentation arising from convergent evolution.
   However, the genes controlling segmentation in each of these groups are the same, leading to a
   rethinking of the taxonomic value of segmentation.

   Figure 6. Examples of body segments as seen in a crayfish. Segmentation of the body allows
   development of various specialized limbs, such as antennae, pincers, walking legs, swimming
   legs, and feeding appendages. Image from Images of Biology (out of print).

Sponges: The Phylum Porifera | Back to Top

   The phylum Porifera ("pore-bearing") consists of approximately 5,000 species of sponges. These
   asymmetrical animals have sac-like bodies that lack tissues, and are usually interpreted as
   representing the cellular level of evolution. Cells from fragmented sponges can
   reorganize/regenerate the sponge organism, something not possible with animals that have
   tissues. Most zoologists consider sponges as offshoots that represent an evolutionary dead-end.,
   although others consider some groups of sponges as being related to other animal groups. Sponges
   are aquatic, largely marine, animals with a great diversity in size, shape, and color.

   Modern sponges greatly resemble some fossil Cambrian sponges. Sponges may have evolved from a
   colonial protozoan, as shown in Figure 8. There are no true tissues in sponges: merely
   specialized cell layers. Epidermal cells in sponges line the outer surface. Collar cells line
   the inner cavity. Beating collar cells produce water currents that flow through pores in sponge
   wall into a central cavity and out through an osculum, the upper opening. A 10 cm tall sponge
   will filter as much as 100 liters of water a day. Amoeboid cells occupy the "inner" layer, along
   with hardened structures known as spicules.

   Sponges feed by drawing water into the body through a network of pores (hence the name porifera,
   pore-bearer) and passing it out through the large opening (osculum) at one end of the body.

   Figure 7. Organization of the sponge body. Note the lack of tissues. Sponges demonstrate the
   cellular level of organization. Also notice the resemblance between the collared
   choanoflagellate cells in the top drawing, and the collar cells in the sponge. Images from

                                            [sponge_1.gif]

   [sponge_2.gif]

   Sponges can reproduce asexually (by budding or from fragments) or sexually. Sponges produce eggs
   and sperm that are released into a central cavity of the sponge, in which the zygote develops
   into a ciliated larva. The larval stage is able to move about while the adult is stationary.

                                        Belize Sponges by MJF

   The fossil record of sponges has been at times quite good. The oldest sponges date from the
   precambrian. One early example of fossil sponges are the archaeocyathids, one of the first
   reef-building animals. Archaeocyathids evolved and went extinct before then end of the Cambrian
   Period. Cladistic analysis by J. Reitner in 1990 suggests archaeocyathids are properly placed in
   the Phylum Porifera instead of having their own phylum. Living sponges fall into three groups:
   the calcareous (an example of which is shown in Figure 9), glass, and demosponges, based on the
   chemical composition of spicules.

Tissues: Jellyfish, Corals and Sea Anemones | Back to Top

   The phylum Cnidaria contains 10,000 species characterized by adult bodies having radial
   symmetry. Cnidarians are aquatic, mostly all marine. The cnidarian body has only the ectoderm
   and endoderm tissue layers, making this group diploblastic. Members of this phylum all have
   stinging cells that eject a barbed thread and possibly a toxin. Only cnidaria have these
   cnidocytes (shown in Figure 9), a specialized cell that contains a nematocyst, a fluid-filled
   capsule containing a long, spirally coiled hollow thread. When the trigger of the cnidocyte is
   touched, the nematocyst is discharged. Some threads merely trap a prey or predator, while others
   have spines that penetrate and inject paralyzing toxins. These toxins make some jellyfish (and a
   related group the box jellies) among the most poisonous of animals.

   Figure 9. Cnidocyte/nematocyst in a cnidarian. These stinging cells allow the animal to capture
   small prey, as well as offer some defense if attacked. Image from Purves et al., Life: The
   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                           [cnidaria_1.gif]

   Cnidarians have two body forms that may occur: a mobile medusa and a sessile (fancy term for not
   mobile) polyp, both of which are shown in Figure 10. Both body forms have tentacles arranged
   around an opening into the two-layered sac-like body. The inner tissue layer (derived from
   endoderm) secretes digestive juices into the gastrovascular cavity, which digests food and
   circulates nutrients (doing the job our circulatory AND digestive systems do). Muscle fibers
   occur at the base of the epidermal and gastrodermal cells, making this the first group of
   muscled animals. Nerve cells located below epidermis near the mesoglea interconnect and form a
   nerve net throughout the body. Cnidarians have both muscle fibers and nerve fibers, making these
   animals capable of directional movement. The nerve net allows transmission of messages in more
   than one direction, possibly an advantage in a radially symmetrical animal, while contraction of
   muscle fibers (under control of the nerve fibers) allows for movement. While they have a nerve
   net, brains are not present.

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                         [cnidariabodies.gif]

   Cells are organized into tissues. The adult in most species of cnidarian is radially
   symmetrical. The typical cnidarian life cycle involves both sexual and asexual reproduction. A
   bilaterally symmetrical larva known as a planula (shown in Figure 11), develops from a zygote.
   The planula moves around and eventually settles down in an appropriate location and grows into
   the adult polyp. The polyp grows and may eventually reproduce asexually to form medusae. Each
   medusa develops gonads and uses meiosis to form gametes.

   Figure 11. Life cycle of a typical cnidarian. In essence we see an "alternation of generations"
   between the sessile polyp phase and the mobile medusa phase. However, unlike plants, both phases
   are diploid. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer
   Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                           [cnidariaLC.gif]

   The phylum Cnidaria is usually subdivided into three taxonomic classes: class Anthozoa, class
   Hydrozoa, and class Schyphozoa.

  Class Anthozoa: Sea Anemones and Corals

   Sea anemones, shown in Figure 12, are solitary polyps 5-100 mm in height and 5-200 mm in
   diameter or larger. They are often brightly colored and look like flowers (specifically
   anemones) on the seafloor. You might remember them from the film Finding Nemo. The anemone's
   thick, heavy body rests on a pedal disk and supports an upward-turned mouth surrounded by hollow
   tentacles. Sea anemones feed on various invertebrates and fish. They attach to a variety of
   substrates, or may be mutualistic with hermit crabs, living attached to crab's shell.

   anchored in place. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by

                                            [anemone.gif]

   Corals may be solitary but most today are colonial. The majority of corals occur in warm shallow
   waters; the accumulation of their calcium-carbonate remains builds reefs. Some corals occur in
   colder waters, so the mere presence of coral does not necessarily indicate a tropical
   environment. Modern scleractinian coral, dominant reef-builders since the Triassic period (some
   230 million years ago), have symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates living within the coral
   body. These dinoflagellates are in the genus Symbiodinium, and are termed collectively
   zooxanthellae, shown in Figure 13a. Figure 13b illustrates several living coral tyypes.

                                            [IMG_0013.JPG]

  Class Hydrozoa: Hydras and Portuguese Man-of-war (Physalia)

   The polyp stage is dominant in members of this taxonomic class. The Portuguese man-of-war is a
   colony of polyps, with the original polyp becoming a gas-filled float. Other polyps specialize
   for feeding or reproduction. The Portuguese man-of-war can cause serious injury to swimmers
   since each tentacle (in reality a string of individual organisms) has numerous nematocysts.

   Hydra, shown in Figure 14, are solitary, freshwater hydrozoan polyps. The body is a small tube
   about one-quarter inch long, best observed with a dissecting microscope. Four to six tentacles
   surround the mouth, the only opening at into the body. Hydra can move from one location by
   gliding or even somersaulting. Hydras have both muscular and nerve fibers, and respond to touch.
   Epidermal cells are termed epitheliomuscular cells and contain muscle fibers. Cnidocytes and
   sensory cells are also present in the epidermis. Interstitial cells can produce an ovary or
   testis, and may assist regeneration. Gland cells secrete digestive juices into the
   gastrovascular cavity into which tentacles have stuffed captured prey. Digestion is completed
   within food vacuoles of nutritive-muscular cells. Nutrients diffuse to the rest of the body.
   Hydras reproduce both sexually asexually (by budding). In sexual reproduction, sperm from a
   testis swim to an egg within an ovary. Following early development within the ovary, a
   protective shell forms and allows the embryo to survive until conditions are optimum. Hydra are
   commonly utilized animals in biology labs.

                                             [hydra.jpg]

  Class Schyphozoa: True Jellyfishes (Aurelia)

   The medusal stage is dominant in jellyfish (Figure 15) and other members of this taxonomic
   class. The polyp remains small and inconspicuous. Jellyfishes also serve as food for larger
   marine animals.

   of the medusa.

  The Fossil Record of Cnidarians

   The fossil record of cnidarians is very good for hard-part containing corals, but usually not as
   good for soft-bodied forms like jellyfish. Corals become dominant reef-building animals during
   the Ordovician, and continue their importance today. Corals, which had appeared possibly as
   early as the late Proterozoic (precambrian, more than 540 million years ago), diversified into a
   number of groups during the Silurian times. Tabulate corals and rugose corals were major
   components of the new, larger reefs built during the Silurian through Permian (the Permian ended
   250 million years ago). Rugose corals included the horn corals, while tabulate corals were
   colonial. Both the rugose and tabulate corals went extinct at the close of the Permian period.
   Figure 16 shows a coral collected in central Arizona.

   Figure 16. Pachyphyllum nevadense magnum from the Martin Formation (Jerome Member), Devonian
   (approiximately 400 million years old) near Pine, Arizona. Image from

                                          [azdevoncoral.jpg]

   Near the end of the Devonian a mass extinction occurred. This one was more severe on marine
   creatures than on the newly established terrestrial forms. The corals were quite seriously
   decimated, and the return of extensive reef building did not occur until the Triassic with the
   evolution of a new group of reef-building corals, the scleractinians (shown in Figure 17).

   Figure 17. Thecosmilia sp., coral colony preserved in chalcedony, from the late Jurassic of
   Germany. Image from http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galleri/montre/english/167_739.htm.

                                            [167_739.jpg]

   Corals were much restricted after the Devonian crisis and the large reefs of the Devonian were
   replaced with smaller reefs known as patch reefs. The role of corals in these new reefs was much
   reduced from what it had been in earlier times.

   Coral reefs, which had been decimated by the Carboniferous extinction returned to prominence
   with the evolution of new groups of reef-building animals and algae.

Bilateral Symmetry and Cephalization: Phylum Platyhelminthes | Back to Top

   The phylum Platyhelminthes contains about 13,000 species of flatworms subdivided into three
   classes: two parasitic and one free-living. The planaria and relatives are freshwater animals
   placed in the class Turbellaria. Flukes are external or internal parasites belonging to the the
   Class Trematoda. Tapeworms are internal parasites and form the Class Cestoda. The phylum as a
   whole has adult bilateral symmetry and cephalization (the development of a head with sensory
   organs, in most members).

   Flatworms have three tissue layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm and a body plan that is
   acoelomate and sac-like with a single opening. The mesoderm layer gives rise to muscles and
   reproductive organs. Free living forms have muscles, a nerve cord, and digestive organs, but
   lack both the respiratory and circulatory systems common to the so-called "higher" animals (in
   other words like ourselves). Flatworms, as shown in Figure 18, have a branched gastrovascular
   cavity that is the site of extracellular digestion and which distributes nutrients throughout
   the body. Gas exchange occurs by diffusion through the skin. Platyhelminths have an excretory
   system that also functions as an osmotic-regulating system. Flatworms have a ladder-style
   nervous system composed of paired ganglia that form a brain connected via nerve cells to sensory
   cells in the body wall.

   Parasitic members of this phylum, such as flukes and tapeworms, are characterized by these
   modifications:
    1. loss of cephalization producing a head bearing hooks and suckers to attach to the host as
       opposed to the sensory organs of free-living forms
    2. extensive development of the reproductive system coinciding with the loss of other systems
       (what do they do but gain food from the host's digestion and reproduce, anyway?)
    3. lack of a well-developed nervous and gastrovascular system (the live in a fairly stable
       environment and the host has already digested their food)
    4. development of a tegument that protects them from host digestive juices

   Both flukes and tapeworms use secondary or intermediate hosts to transport the species from
   primary host to primary host. The primary host is infected with the sexually mature adult while
   the secondary host contains the larval stage(s).

  Class Turbellaria

   The class Turbellaria includes freshwater planaria such as Dugesia that feed on small organisms
   or the remains of small creatures, as well as often colorful marine forms. Their small size and
   ease of care also make Dugesia a common animals in introductory biology labs. The planarian head
   is normally arrow-shaped, with side extensions that are sensory organs for detection of food and
   the presence of other organisms. Flatworms have two light-sensitive eyespots that have
   pigmentation making them look cross-eyed. The presence of three muscle layers facilitates varied
   movement. Gland cells secrete a mucous material upon which the animal slides or glides.

   The animal captures food by wrapping itself around its prey, entangling it in slime, and pinning
   it down. The pharynx is a muscular tube that extrudes from the mouth and through which food is
   ingested. Often in biology labs the "prey" can be liver and students can watch the pharynx
   extend out of the worm's body.

   The flame cell system functions in excretion and consists of a series of interconnecting canals
   that run length of the body on either side of the longitudinal axis and side branches of the
   canals, each ending in a flame cell. The flame cell is a bulb-shaped cell containing a tuft of
   cilia within the hollow interior of the bulb. The cilia move back and forth, bringing water into
   the canals that empty through pores at the body surface. This flame-cell system functions in
   both water excretion and osmotic regulation in a typical freshwater, free-living flatworm.

   Planaria can reproduce both sexually and asexually. They can constrict beneath the pharynx and
   each half will grow into a whole animal by the process of regeneration. Planaria are
   hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female sex organs, and can cross-fertilize each other.
   Fertilized eggs are enclosed in a cocoon and hatch in two to three weeks.

  Class Trematoda

   The class Trematoda includes flukes. Flukes, such as blood, liver, and lung flukes are named
   after the organs they inhabit. Fluke bodies tend to be oval and elongate. They lack a definite
   head but have an oral sucker surrounded by sensory papillae. Flukes have reduced digestive,
   nervous, and excretory systems. Reproductive systems are well developed and usually
   hermaphroditic.

   The blood fluke, shown in Figure 20, causes schistosomiasis, a disease found predominantly in
   tropical Africa and South America. Unlike most flukes, blood flukes are male or female. Flukes
   deposit eggs in blood vessels around the host's intestine. The eggs migrate to the intestine and
   are passed out with feces. Larvae hatch in water and swim about until they detect and enter a
   particular species of snail. The larvae reproduce asexually and eventually leave the snail. Once
   larvae penetrate human skin they begin to mature in the liver, and implant in blood vessels of
   the small intestine. A weakened person is then more likely to die from secondary diseases.

                                            [01fluke.gif]



   The Chinese liver fluke, shown in Figure 21, requires two intermediate hosts. Humans become
   infected when they eat uncooked fish. Adults migrate to the liver and deposit eggs in the bile
   duct, which carries the eggs to the intestine. The larval flukes must then pass through two
   intermediate hosts, a snail and a fish.

  Class Cestoda

   The class Cestoda consists of the tapeworms, an example of which is shown in Figure 22. The
   tapeworm scolex (head/neck region) has hooks and suckers that allow the organism to attach to
   the host's intestinal wall. Behind the head is a short neck and then a long string of
   proglottids. Each proglottid segment contains a full set of both male and female sex organs and
   very little other structure. Since the animal does produce wastes, it retains its excretory
   canals, but no digestive system is needed. Being sessile organisms in a fairly stable
   environment, tapeworms have only rudiments of nerves. Following fertilization, proglottids
   become a bag of eggs that when mature, breaks off and passes out with feces. If the eggs of
   tapeworms are ingested by pigs or cattle, the larvae become encysted in the muscle of the hosts.
   The covering of ingested eggs is digested away and the larvae burrow through the intestinal wall
   and travel by bloodstream to lodge and encyst in muscle; a cyst is a hard-walled structure
   sheltering a larval worm. If humans eat the meat of infected pigs or cattle and fail to cook it
   properly, they too become infected.

The Phylum Nemertea: Ribbon Worms | Back to Top

   The phylum Nemertea include approximately 650 species of marine ribbon worms. Ribbon worms have
   a distinctive eversible proboscis stored in a rhynchocoel. When the walls of the rhynchocoel
   contract, the proboscis extends out of the body. The proboscis is a long, hollow tube that can
   be everted and shot outward through a pore located just above the mouth. It is used primarily
   for prey capture, and for defense, locomotion, and burrowing. This phylum is included as the
   organisms are also triploblastic. Several of the fossils from the Cambrian-aged Burgess Shale
   are interpreted as ribbon worms, and some extremely long worms have been found in the
   Mediterranean (up to 100 feet long) and in the ocean under the Antarctic ice shelves.

The Phylum Rotifera | Back to Top

   Rotifers (shown in Figure 23) belong to the phylum Rotifera, which contains about 2,000 species.
   Rotifers are often observed in biology lab preparations. Their digestive tract is the inner tube
   and the rest of the animal is the outer tube (of a tube-within-a-tube body plan). Rotifers are
   microscopic and abundant in freshwater. A crown of cilia (corona) forms a rotating wheel that
   serves as both an organ of locomotion and acts to deliver food to the mouth.

   aquaria and cultures, but still exhibit the tube-with-a-tube body plan. Image from Purves et
   al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH

The Tube-within-a-tube Body Plan: Phylum Nematoda | Back to Top

   The phylum Nematoda consists of several hundred thousand species of roundworms, shown in Figure
   24. Most are free-living, although some are parasitic (pinworms are thought to infect 30% of all
   US children). Adult nematodes have a pseudocoelom (tube-within-a-tube), a closed fluid-filled
   space that acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, aids in circulation and dispersal of nutrients.
   Nematodes lack a circulatory system, but do have a well developed digestive system.

   One nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, has only one thousand genes in its genome and its
   developmental pathways are well known. C. elegans serves as a model for eukaryote gene systems
   and has been extensively studied as part of the human genome project.

   Ascaris is a parasitic roundworm, and is shown in Figure 25. These worms are unsegmented and
   have a smooth outside wall. They move by whiplike motions. Mating produces eggs that mature in
   the soil, limiting most roundworms to to warmer climates. When eggs are swallowed, larvae burrow
   through the intestinal wall, moving to the liver, heart and/or lungs. Once within the lungs,
   larvae molt and, after ten days, migrate up the windpipe to throat where they are swallowed. In
   the intestine, the mature worms mate and the female deposits eggs that are passed out of the
   body with feces. Feces must reach the mouth of the next host to complete the life cycle, thus,
   proper sanitation is an important aspect to prevent infection.

   Humans contract Trichinella (the roundworm that causes the disease trichinosis, illustrated in
   Figure 26) by eating raw pork containing encysted larvae. Mature female adults burrow into the
   wall of the small intestine. Live offspring are carried by the bloodstream to the skeletal
   muscles where they encyst. Religious dietary injunctions against eating pork may in part be a
   reflection of the prevalence of this disease in the Middle East.

   Filarial worms cause various diseases. Dirofilaria, shown in Figure 27, causes heartworm in
   dogs, and is a common filarial worm in temperate zones.

   Elephantiasis, a disease associated with tropical Africa, and is also caused by a filarial worm
   that utilizes mosquitos as secondary hosts. Adult worms reside in and block lymphatic vessels.
   This results in limbs of an infected individual swelling to monstrous size. Elephantiasis is
   treatable in its early stages but not after scar tissue has blocked lymphatic vessels.
