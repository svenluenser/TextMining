Primates and Their Adaptations | Back to Top

   Mammals developed from primitive mammal-like reptiles during the Triassic Period, some 200-245
   million years ago. After the terminal Cretaceous extinction (65 million years ago) eliminated
   the dinosaurs, mammals as one of the surviving groups, underwent an adaptive radiation during
   the Tertiary Period. The major orders of mammals developed at this time, including the Primates
   to which humans belong.

   Other primates include the tarsiers, lemurs, gibbons, monkeys, and apes. Although we have
   significant differences from other primates, we share an evolutionary history that includes
   traits such as opposable thumbs, stereoscopic vision, larger brains, and nails replacing claws.

   Primates are relatively unspecialized mammals: they have no wings, still have all four limbs,
   cannot run very fast, have generally weak teeth, and lack armor or thick protective hides.
   However, the combination of primate adaptations that include larger brains, tool use, social
   structure, stereoscopic color vision, highly developed forelimbs and hands, versatile teeth, and
   upright posture, place them among the most advanced mammals (at least as judged from an
   anthrocentric perspective!).

   Approximately 20 million years ago central and east Africa was densely forested. Climatic
   changes resulting from plate tectonic movements and episodes of global cooling about 15 million
   years ago caused a replacement of the forest by a drier-adapted savanna mixed with open areas of
   forest. During the course of hominid evolution, periodic climate changes would trigger bursts of
   evolution and/or extinction.

   Primates have modifications to their ulna and radius (bones of the lower arm) allowing them to
   turn their hand without needing to turn their elbow. Many primates can also swivel or turn their
   arms at the shoulder. These two adaptations offer advantages to life in the trees.

   Primates have five digits on their forelimbs. They are able to grasp objects with their
   forelimbs in what is known as a prehensile movement. A second modification makes one of the
   digits opposable, allowing the tips of the fingers and thumb to touch.

   Placement of the eyes on the front of the head increases depth perception, an advantageous trait
   in tree-dwelling primates. Changes in the location of rods and cones in the eye adapted primates
   for color vision as well as peripheral vision in dim light.

   Upright posture allows a primate to view its surroundings as well as to use its hands for some
   other task. Hominids, the lineage leading to humans, had changes in the shape and size of their
   pelvis, femur, and knees that allowed bipedalism (walking on two legs). The change from
   quadruped to biped happened in stages, culminating in humans, who can walk or run on two legs.

   Several trends of primate evolution are evident in the teeth and jaw. First, change in the
   geometry of the jaw reduced the snout into a flat face. Second, changes in tooth arrangement and
   numbers increased the efficiency of those teeth for grinding food. Third, about 1.5 million
   years ago our diet changed from fruits and vegetables to include meat.

Origin of Apes and Hominids | Back to Top

   The fossil record indicates primates evolved about approximately 30 million years ago in Africa.
   One branch of primates evolved into the Old and New World Monkeys, the other into the hominoids
   (the line of descent common to both apes and man). Fossil hominoids occur in Africa during the
   Miocene epoch of the Tertiary period. They gave rise to an array of species in response to major
   climate fluxes in their habitats. However, the nature of those habitats leads to an obscuration
   of the line that leads to humans (the hominids).

   Until a few years ago, the ramapiths were thought to have given rise to the hominids. We now
   consider ramapiths ancestral to the orangutang. The hominid line arose from some as-yet-unknown
   ancestor. Lacking fossil evidence, biochemical and DNA evidence suggests a split of the hominid
   from hominoid line about 6 to 8 million years ago.

   Australopithecus afarensis, the first of the human-like hominids we know of, first appeared
   about 3.6-4 million years ago. This species had a combination of human (bipedalism) and apelike
   features (short legs and relatively long arms). The arm bones were curved like chimps, but the
   elbows were more human-like. Scientists speculate that A. afarensis spent some time climbing
   trees, as well as on the ground.

   Australopithecus ramidus is an older species, about 4.4 million years, and is generally
   considered more anatomically primitive than A. afarensis. The relationship between the two
   species remains to be solved.

   The role of A. afarensis as the stem from which the other hominids arose is in some dispute.
   About 2 million years ago, after a long million year period of little change, as many as six
   hominid species evolved in response to climate changes associated with the beginning of the Ice
   Age. Two groups developed: the australopithecines, generally smaller brained and not users of
   tools; and the line that led to genus Homo, larger brained and makers and users of tools. The
   australopithecines died out 1 million years ago; Homo, despite their best efforts (atomic
   weapons, pollution) are still here!

   With an incomplete fossil record, australopithecines, at least the smaller form, A. africanus,
   was thought ancestral to Homo. Recent discoveries, however have caused a reevaluation of that
   hypothesis. One pattern is sure, human traits evolved at different rates and at different times,
   in a mosaic: some features (skeletal, dietary) establishing themselves quickly, others
   developing later (toolmaking, language, use of fire).

   A cluster of species developed about 2-2.5 million years ago in Africa. Homo had a larger brain
   and a differently shaped skull and teeth than the australopithecines. About 1.8 million years
   ago, early Homo gave rise to Homo erectus, the species thought to have been ancestral to our
   own.

   Soon after its origin (1.8 million but probably older than 2 million years ago) in Africa, Homo
   erectus appears to have migrated out of Africa and into Europe and Asia. Homo erectus differed
   from early species of Homo in having a larger brain size, flatter face, and prominent brow
   ridges. Homo erectus is similar to modern humans in size, but has some differences in the shape
   of the skull, a receding chin, brow ridges, and differences in teeth. Homo erectus was the first
   hominid to:
    1. provide evidence the social and cultural aspects of human evolution
    2. leave Africa (living in Africa, Europe, and Asia)
    3. use fire
    4. have social structures for food gathering
    5. utilize permanent settlements
    6. provide a prolonged period of growth and maturation after birth

   Between 100,000 and 500,000 years ago, the world population of an estimated 1 million Homo
   erectus disappeared, replaced by a new species, Homo sapiens. How, when and where this new
   species arose and how it replaced its predecessor remain in doubt. Answering those questions has
   become a multidisciplinary task.

   Two hypotheses differ on how and where Homo sapiens originated.
    1. The Out-of-Africa Hypothesis proposes that some H. erectus remained in Africa and continued
       to evolve into H. sapiens, and left Africa about 100,000-200,000 years ago. From a single
       source, H. sapiens replaced all populations of H. erectus. Human populations today are thus
       all descended from a single speciation event in Africa and should display a high degree of
       genetic similarity. Support for this hypothesis comes from DNA studies of mitochondria:
       since African populations display the greatest diversity of mitochondrial DNA, modern humans
       have been in Africa longer than they have been elsewhere. Calculations suggest all modern
       humans are descended from a population of African H. sapiens numbering as few as 10,000.
    2. The Regional Continuity Hypothesis suggests that regional populations of H. erectus evolved
       into H. sapiens through interbreeding between the various populations. Evidence from the
       fossil record and genetic studies supports this idea.

   Which hypothesis is correct? Scientists can often use the same "evidence" to support contrasting
   hypotheses depending on which evidence (fossils or molecular clock/DNA studies) one gives more
   weight to. The accuracy of the molecular clock, so key to the out-of-Africa hypothesis, has
   recently been questioned. Recent studies on the Y-chromosome seem to weaken the regional
   continuity hypothesis by indicating a single point-of-origin for our species some 270,000 years
   ago. Continued study will no doubt reveal new evidence and undoubtedly new hypotheses will
   arise. It is a task for all of us to weigh the evidence critically and reach a supportable
   conclusion, whether we are scientists or not.

The Neandertals | Back to Top

   Archaic H. sapiens lived from 500,000 to 30,000 years ago and combined features of H. sapiens
   with those of H. erectus. The Neandertals, considered in this group, lived in Europe and western
   Asia between 100,000 and 30,000 years ago before their disappearance. Neandertals were
   larger-brained than modern humans, had a sloping forehead, prominent brow ridges and a receding
   chin. They had a very prominent nose and ranged in height from 5 foot 2 inches (average female)
   to 5 foot 6 inches (average male).

   Despite their image as brutish simpletons, Neandertals were the first humans to bury their dead
   with artifacts, indicating abstract thought, perhaps a belief in an after-life. They lived in
   free-standing settlements, as well as caves. Neandertal tools were more sophisticated than H.
   erectus' tools, employing handles to gain extra leverage.

   Did Neandertals evolve gradually into modern humans, or were they replaced by modern forms
   originating from a single population? The answer to that depends on the answer to the question
   of the origin of H. sapiens from H. erectus. The out-of-Africa hypothesis suggests Neandertals
   were a separate species (H. neandertalensis) replaced as modern humans (H. sapiens) spread from
   Africa. The regional continuity hypothesis suggests Neandertals were a subspecies (H. sapiens
   neandertalensis) that evolved into modern humans (H. sapiens sapiens).

Agriculture and Migrations | Back to Top

   Since the evolution of H. erectus, migrations have been a fact of human existence, helping to
   spread genetic diversity as well as technological innovation. The most recent innovations have
   not been physical, but rather cultural.

   The Neolithic transition, about 10,000 years ago, involved the change from hunter-gatherer
   societies to agricultural ones based on cultivation of plants and domesticated animals. Evidence
   suggests this began in the Middle East and spread outward via migrations.

   Genetic studies suggest agriculture spread by the migration of farmers into hunter-gatherer
   societies. This would produce a genetic blurring as the farmers interbred with the indigenous
   peoples, a pattern supported by genetics.

   Most anthropologists agree that the New World was populated by a series of three migrations over
   the temporary land connection between Asia and North America. The immigrants spread southward,
   eventually reaching Tierra del Fuego in the southernmost part of South America.
    1. Anthropological and linguistic studies find three groups of peoples:
    2. The Amerinds, who spread across North and South America
    3. The Na-Denes, who occupied the northwestern region of North America
    4. The Eskaleuts, Eskimo and Aleut peoples who live in the far north.

   Mitochondrial DNA studies find four distinct groups descended from peoples of Siberia. Amerind
   mtDNA suggests two waves of migration (one perhaps as old as 21-42 thousand years ago). The
   genetic model confirms the accepted ideas about human migration into the Americas and suggests a
   possible fourth wave.
