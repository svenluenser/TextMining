   So much of the biology studied in introductory classes deals with the accomplishments of a small
   group of people: white males. There are several reasons for this, including the exclusion of
   women from academe for many years. This has changed. Please visit the links below and answer a
   short series of questions pertaining to the significance of achievements by the following
   people:

  Mary Anning

   Mary Anning (1799-1847) During her lifetime Mary Anning, an untrained Englishwoman who supported
   her family by fossil collecting, made a number of significant discoveries, including the first
   ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Despite her beimng hailed as "the greatest fossilist ever", her
   life has been made the subject of several books and articles, yet little of her life is really
   known. This website at the Museum of Paleontology and the University of California at Berkeley
   offers a short biography and listing of her contributions to the early days of paleontology.

   work as a fossil collector., along with quoites from her as well as about her. (URL:

  Jill Bargonetti-Chavarria

   Jill Bargonetti-Chavarria Dr. Bargonetti-Chavarria is one of the few contemporary minority
   scientists on this list, and also among the youngest. In 1997 President Clinton awarded her the
   prestigious Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which is the highest
   governmental honor bestowed on scientists early in their research careers. Her research has
   dealt with P53, which is a gene that assists in the suppression of tumor cells. In addition to
   being an accomplished researcher she is recognized for her teaching skills, an uncommon
   combination in modern academe. (URL:
