   The Paleozoic era literally translates as the "time of ancient life" and spans the time period
   between 544 and 245 million years ago. The Paleozoic is the first of three eras within the
   Phanerozoic eon (the time of visible life). While life originated during the Archean and
   increased in complexity during the earlier Proterozoic, the Paleozoic era is marked by the
   spread of animals with hard preservable parts such as shells and exoskeletons. This has led to
   what is popularly known as the Cambrian Explosion, the sudden appearance of a stupendous array
   of animal life, much of which is not closely related to modern forms. Despite extinctions at
   various times, the Paleozoic is notable for the increasing modernization of life. The late
   Paleozoic, the subject of this chapter, saw the spread of plant life over the land surface and
   the emergence and diversification of amphibians and their descendants the reptiles as dominant
   animal life on land. Diversification of fish, which began during the Silurian period continued
   unabated during the Devonian Period. By the end of the Paleozoic, almost all major groups of
   life, except the flowering plants and mammals, had developed. The Paleozoic ended in the
   greatest mass extinction event in world history. During this massive die-off nearly 95% of all
   marine species went extinct. The cause of this greatest catastrophe in Earth history has been
   much investigated and scientific consensus of its cause is emerging.

   During the Paleozoic we see several major advances in life. The aformentioned Cambrian Explosion
   is the first. The evolution of plants from some group of green algae during the Ordovician is
   another, since these plants moved from water onto land, paving the way for vertebrate animals to
   follow. The first vertebrates, amphibians, were little more than legged fish, although their
   remote descendants would come to rule the land as reptiles, the first truly terrestrial
   vertebrates.

  The Devonian | Back to Top

   The Devonian period (410 to 360 million years ago) saw a continued diversifiaction of life on
   the land, including the first terrestrial vertebrates, the amphibians, and the first forests of
   trees. In the waters fish continued their diversification with the rise of the lobe-finned and
   ray-finned fish. Invertebrates such as crinoids, coral, and brachiopods thrived in shallow seas
   during the Devonian.

    Life in the Water

      Invertebrates

   Brachiopods continued their diversification in the Devonian seas. One important group, the
   spiriferids, produced shells with elongated hinges, as seen in the image below. The Devonian
   marked the time of greatest brachiopod diversity, approximately 200 genera have been described.

   Rugose and tabulate coral continued to make major contributions to the formation of Devonian
   reefs. Crinoids and other echinoderms were prominent in many fossil assemblages.

   Cephalopods also underwent an increase in forms, notably the ammonoid group known as the
   goniatites. These coiled, chambered nautiloids left a great many fossils, some of which are
   quite aesthetically appealing.

   this specimen the surrounding matrix has been cut away and the fossils cut to reveal the inner
   chambers. Image from http://www.extinctions.com, used with permission.

   The ammonoids underwent three separate diversifications from a nautiloid-like stock. In each
   case the fold pattern of sutures became more complex. These sutire patterns are fantastic
   characters for identifying species, making ammonoids excellent index fossils. The first of these
   occurrences was the goniatites, a group that ranged from the Devonian to the Permian. The
   ceratites are a Triassic group, while the last group, the ammonites ranged from the Triassic to
   the Cretaceous. Ammonoids finally went extinct in the great end-of-the- Cretaceous extinction.
   Nautiloids are represented today by the Nautilus.

      Vertebrates

   The various fish groups that had appeared during the Silurian period (or in a few cases possibly
   even earlier) continued into the Devonian. The Devonian has been called the "Age of the Fishes"
   because oif the tremendous diversity of fish groups that evolved during this period of geologic
   time.

   Small, jawless, and finless ostracoderms were the earliest vertebrates. They were filter
   feeders, but probably were also able to move water through their gills by muscular action.
   Ostracoderms have been found as fossils from the Cambrian through Devonian periods, when the
   group finally went extinct. Although extant jawless fishes lack protection, many early jawless
   fishes had large defensive head shields.

                                           [aostrderm.gif]

   http://www.gpc.peachnet.edu/~pgore/geology/geo102/devonian.htm.

   The first jawed fish were the Placoderms, an extinct group of Devonian-aged jawed fishes.
   Placoderms were armored with heavy plates and had strong jaws and paired pectoral and pelvic
   fins. Paired fins allow fish to balance and to maneuver well in water, which facilitate both
   predation and escape.

                                [aplacodermmodel.jpg] [aplacoderm.jpg]

   The fossil on the right is a cast of the placoderm, Bothriolepis, and is from

   of the placoderm Coccosteus and is from
   http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galleri/montre/english/x19.htm.

   The evolution of jaws is an example of evolutionary modification of existing structures to
   perform new functions. Jaws are modified gill arches, and allowed the exploitation of new roles
   in the habitats: predators with powerful jaws. There are two classes of jawed fish: the
   cartilaginous fish and the bony fish.

   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   The class Chondrichthyes contains approximately 850 species of skates, rays, and sharks. They
   have jaws, lots of teeth, paired fins, and a cartilage endoskeleton. Cartilaginous fish first
   appeared during the Devonian period and expanded in diversity during the Carboniferous and
   Permian before nearly disappearing during the great extinction that occurred near the end of the
   Permian. Some fragmentary evidence suggests cartilaginous fish were present during the
   Ordovician, although the best skeletal evidence is from the Devonian. Despite scanty skeletal
   presence (cartilage not preserving nearly so well as bone), shark teeth are common fossils in
   some deposits.

   The crossopterygian fish (represented by the marine extant deep-living coelacanth and extinct
   freshwater forms) are regarded as ancestors of early amphibians. Extinct crossopterygians had
   strong fins, lungs, and a streamlined body capable of swimming as well as traveling short
   distances out of water.

    Life on the Land

      Plants

   One of the most famous fossil plant localities that formed during the Devonian is the Rhynie
   Chert from Scotland. This deposit is dated as early Devonian and records in fine detail cells of
   the earlier land vascular plants as well as other fossils. Paleogeographic recponstructions and
   other evidence suggest the environment was tropical to subtropical. Fossils from the Rynie Chert
   were buried in short-lived freshwater deposits that later were subjected to replacement of
   organic material with silica, forming a chert deposit that preserved in great detail the
   internal cells of the fossils. Fungi, including mycorrhizal fungi, also have been recovered from
   the Rhynie Chert, suggesting the symbiosis of plants and fungi is indeed long and essential.
   Fossils assignable to insects and crustaceans have also been recovered.

   Rhynia is an early vascular plant. Like the Silurian plant Cooksonia, Rhynia lacked leaves and
   roots. One of the species formerly assigned to this genus, R. major, has since been reclassified
   as Aglaophyton major. Some paleobotanists consider A. major a bryophyte, however, it does have a
   separate free-living sporophyte that is more prominent than the gametophyte, but appears to lack
   lignified conducting cells. The remaining species, R. gwynne-vaughanii is an undoubted vascular
   plant.

   The Rhynie chert is one of the most famous plant fossil localities in the world. This deposit
   has been of extrodinary historical and evolutionary importance in our understanding of early
   land plants and their environment. Several excellent web pages have been developed that describe
   plant, algal and fungal remains from the chert. Here, in the photo on the left, is a hand
   specimen of Rhynie chert showing numerous stem-like axes and other structures in various planes
   of section. On the right is a higher magnification view showing what this matrix looks like
   under low magnification. Image and text from

   The zosterophyllophytes were an important early Devonian group that is often mentioned as
   ancestral to the lycophytes. These plants had small leaf-like ennations that projected from the
   stems. Ennations are not considered to be leaves since they contain no vascular tissue as is
   found in leaves. Sporangia in this group were not located on the ends of stems, but rather along
   the sides of the stems, a feature also seen in lycophytes. Sawdonia, shown below, a leafless
   Devonian plant covered with spiny projections, is a member of this group.

                                          [asusawdonia1.JPG]

   Sawdonia is a member of the zosterophylls. This group is thought to have some relationship to
   the lycopods, either as lycopod ancestors or as their sister group. In this photo you can see
   the numerous spiny enations that typically cover the surface of these plants.. Image and text

   The trimeophytes were larger plants of the early-middle Devonian. Some trimerophytes are thought
   ancestral to the sphenopsids and progymnosperms of the later Devonian. Unlike the rhyniophytes
   (such as Rhynia) and the zosterophyllophytes, trimerophytes did not produce equal (dichotomous)
   branches. Instead they branched in such a way that one branch appeared to be the central stem
   and the other a side shoot.

   dimensional nature of the plant. These fossils were preserved in thick mats of plant remains and
   were studied in an interesting way. It was possible to put the whole rock into a vat of acid,
   dissolve the rock matrix and lift out individual plant fragments. These fragments were
   re-embedded in bioplastic. Both blocks (on the left and right) show several stem axes and, at
   the top, elongate paired sporangia on forked branching systems. Image and text from

      The Lycophytes

   Plants belonging to the division Lycophyta, have their sporangia organized into strobili (sing.:
   strobilus). Leaves that contained vascular tissue are another major advance for this group.

   Drepanophycus is a middle Devonian lycophyte from the Northern Hemisphere. Its features are very
   similar to modern lycophytes. Sometimes this genus goes under the name Asteroxylon.

   leaves, placement of sporangia on the upper surface of the sporophylls, and stem anatomy that
   are all consistent with modern lycophytes. Image from
   http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/IB181/VPL/Lyco/Lyco2.html.

                                        [asucolpedoxylon.JPG]

   Archaeosigillaria and Colpedoxylon are two Devonian lycopods known from areas in upstate New
   York. In contrast to most lycopods which typically have simple, unforked microphylls, these
   plants produce leaves with branching tips. Both Archaeosigillaria and Colpedoxylon have leaves
   that trifurcate, or have three-pointed tips. Unfortunately our material does not show these
   details very well. The most complex of these lycopods, Leclercqia, has five-forked leaves. These
   plants suggest that leaves may have arisen in lycopods both by enations and by planation of a
   branching system. On the left is Archaeosigillaria, and on the right, Colpedoxylon. Images and
   text from http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/plb407/kpigg/colpedoxylon.htm, used with permission of K.B.
   Pigg.

   The major fossil groups of lycophytes are the lepidodendrids and sigillarids, often referred to
   as the arborescent lycopods because they usually were large trees. During the middle Devonian
   lycophytes retaind their herbaceous habit, but also began to grow taller, more than a few meters
   high at first, and developed the capability for secondary growth to produce wood, allowing the
   plants to grow still taller. Modern lycophytes lack secondary growth and are entirely
   herbaceous.

      The Sphenophytes

   Once dominant elements in the Paleozoic forests, sphenophytes (also known as the equisetophytes)
   are today relegated to minor roles as stream-side herbaceous plants. The group is defined by
   their jointed stems, with many extremely small leaves being produced at a node, production of
   spores in cones borne at the tips of stems, and spores bearing elaters (devices to aid in spore
   dispersal). The fossil members of this group are often encountered in coal deposits of
   Carboniferous age in North America and Europe. The first sphenophytes show up during the late
   Devonian, most likely evolving from some group of the trimerophytes.

      The Ferns

   Ferns reproduce by spores from which the free-living bisexual gametophyte generation develops.
   There are 12,000 species of ferns today, although the fossil history of ferns shows them to have
   been a dominant plant group during the Paleozoic Era. The first ferns also appear by the end of
   the Devonian. Some anatomical similarities suggest that ferns and sphenophytes may have shared a
   common ancestor within the trimerophytes.

      The Progymnosperms

   The progymnosperms are an extinct group of free-sporing (nonseed) plants that have fern-like
   leaves and reproductive structures attached to gymnosperm-like stems with large amounts of wood.
   Some progymnosperms produced a single type of spore (homospory) while otyhers produced small and
   large spores, a condition known as heterospory. This latter group may include the ancestors of
   seed plants.

   The most famous oif the progymnosperms, Archaeopteris, was first assigned to the ferns. During
   the 1960s paleobotanist Charles B. Beck convincingly demonstrated that this common late Devonian
   leaf fossil was actually produced by the same plant that also produced a common Devonian
   petrified wood known as Callixylon.

   http://www.mdgekko.com/devonian/neighborhood/plants/archaeopteris.html.

      The Seed Ferns

   The seed ferns, fancy name pteridosperms (literally fern-seed), appeared during the late
   Devonian. One of the more important groups of seed ferns was the lyginopterids, small vine-like
   plants that probably grew on other plants. This group produced seeds in a cupule-like structure.

      Animals

   Perhaps the earliest animals ashore were the invertebrates, most likely groups of arthropods.
   The oldest known terrestrial arthropod is a trigonotarbid from the Silurian. Trigonotarbids
   superficially looked like spiders. The major groups of terrestrial arthropods were present
   during the Devonian: chelicerates including mites, spiders, and arachnids; and made the
   transition to land life, and uniramians including flightless insects, centipedes and millipedes.

   The earliest terrestrial vertebrate fossils are from the late Devonian. These "stem tetrapods"
   as they are known, were essentially fish out of water. The late Devonian lungfish had two
   groups, the Dipnoi (which includes the living African, Auistralian, and South American
   lungfishes) and the Crossopterygii, whose sole living member is the coelacanth Latimeria.
   Comparison of the skull, forelimb, and tooth structure of Devonian crosspterygians such as
   Eusthenopteron with similar areas in a more specialized tetrapod such as Ichthyostega supports
   descent of amphibians from Devonian crossopterygians. However, some molecular studies point to
   descent of the amphibians from the lungfish, the Dipnoi.

    The Devonian World

   The Devonian world was one of major changes, both in the biological realm and the geological
   one. The two large landmasses, Gondwana to the south and Laurasia to the north began moving
   toward the formation (again) of a world supercontinent, Pangaea. Mountain building events were
   occurring on the edges of each of these continents. On Laurasia, the collision of Eurpoe with
   Laurentia produced the beginnings of the Appalachian Mountains. Changes at the end of the
   Devonian brought an end to the time of extensive reef building.

    The Devonian Extinction

   Near the end of the Devonian another mass extinction occurred. This one was more severe on
   marine creatures than on the newly established terrestrial forms. The corals were quite
   seriously decimated, and the return of extensive reef building did not happen until the Triassic
   with the evolution of a new group of reef-building corals, the scleractinians. Brachiopods,
   trilobites and primitive fish groups either were diminished or completely snuffed out by this
   extinction event.

   Global cooling tied to Gondwanan glaciation has been proposed as the cause of the Devonian
   extinction, as it was also suspected of causing the terminal Ordovician extinction. Rocks in
   parts of Gondwana suggest a glacial event. The forms of marine life most affected by the
   extinction were the warm water to tropical ones. Another hypothesis for this extinction is that
   an asteroid impact caused a global cooling. There are several impact sites known to be of the
   right potential age to have been involved in this extinction. Neither hypothesis, glaciation or
   impact, is unequivocally supported by the available data.

  The Carboniferous: Coal Swamps and Glaciers | Back to Top

   The Carboniferous period (360 to 286 million years ago) in Europe is better known in North
   America as the Mississippian period and the Pennsylvanian period. The regression of the
   Mississippian seas from North America provided a natural break in deposition that was not echoed
   in Europe. In this segment the early (or lower) Carboniferous will equate to the Mississippian,
   and the late (or upper) Carboniferous will represent the Pennsylvanian.

                                             [car04b.gif]

   The Carboniferous forests produced tremendous biomass which, when buried, eventually turned into
   massive coal deposits of the age. Image and text from
   http://seaborg.nmu.edu/earth/carbonif/car04b.html.

   The Carboniferous takes its name from the widespread occurrence of coal deposits formed during
   this timespan in Europe and North America. Coal is a sedimentary rock composed of plant debris
   (and occasionally material from other creatues) that was deposited in abog or swamp that had
   little biological activity at its bottom. This led to preservation of the plant leaves, stems,
   pollen and other structures, although with continued burial these structures become much less
   distinct. Time and pressure combine with chemical changes to turn the plant material into coal.
   Fluctuating sea-levels during the Carboniferous contributed to the preservation of many coal
   environments.

    Life in the Water

   The marine environments, following the rebound from the late Devonian mass extinction underwent
   changes, with crinoids becoming more dominant and diverse. The early Carboniferous is sometimes
   known as the "age of crinoids". The primitive, armored Devonian fish were replaced by more
   "modern" ray-finned fish.

      Invertebrates

   Fenestrate bryozoans were particularly common in the early Carboniferous seas. Archimedes, a
   corkscrew-shaped fossil, represents the secreted support of a colony of bryozoans that are
   usually no longer present.  The so-called lacy bryozoans were among the first invertebrate
   groups to recover after the Devonian extinction.

                                           [archimedes.jpg]

   Image from http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Screw/bryozoa/bryozoa.html.

   Brachiopods became increasingly important animals. The spiriferids that began their
   diversification during the Devonian quickly recovered from the Devonian die-off and resumed or
   increased their ecological dominance during the early Carboniferous.

   Corals were much restricted after the Devonian crisis and the large reefs of the Devonian were
   replaced with smaller reefs known as patch reefs. The role of corals in these new reefs was much
   reduced from what it had been in earlier times. Crinoids were also important contributors to the
   building of these small reefs, as were blastoids, a similar group of echinoderms.

   Forminiferans, a group of unicellular protozoans that date from the Cambrian, developed a new
   series of forms with calcareous and porcellaneous tests (foram "shells" are technically known as
   tests). The fusulinids were a large group of foraminiferans that reached sizes of several
   centimeters in length. The fusulinids were very important during the Permian before their
   extinction at that period's close.

      Vertebrates

   Sharks and bony fish continued to diversify during the good times of the early Carboniferous,
   before the dropping sea levels of the late Carboniferous caused loss of habitat. The earliest
   bony fish to dominate the aquatic environment were the palaeoniscoids, a group that raged in
   time from the Carboniferous to the Triassic. Palaeoniscoids somewhat resembled modern bony fish
   but had significant anatomical differences with modern fish, which belong to a later-evolved
   group. The palaeoniscoids were extinct by the end of the Mesozoic era. Sturgeon are members of a
   distantly related group to the palaeoniscoids. Sturgeon have a cartilage skeleton and thus a
   poor fossil record.

    Life on Land

      Plants

   The Lycophytes became even more significant elements of the world's flora during the
   Carboniferous. These non-seed plants evolved into trees in the fossil genera Lepidodendron and
   Sigillaria, with heights reaching up to 40 meters and 20-30 meters respectively. Lepidodendron
   trunks can be over 1 meter in diameter. However, the stems are composed of less wood (secondary
   xylem) that usually is found in gymnosperm and angiosperm trees.

   We know much about the anatomy of these coal-age lycopods because of an odd type of preservation
   known as a coal ball. Coal balls can be peeled and the plants that are anatomically preserved
   within them laboriously studied to learn the details of cell structure of these coal age plants.
   Additionally, we have some exceptional petrifactions and compressions that reveal different
   layers of the plants' structure. Estimates place the bulk, up to 70%, of coal material as being
   derived from lycophytes.

   Lepidodendron was a heterosporous tree common in coal swamps. As with many large plant fossils,
   one rarely if ever finds the entire tree preserved intact. Consequently there are a number of
   fossil plant genera that are "organ taxa" and represent only the leaves (such as
   Lepidophylloides), reproductive structures (Lepidostrobus), stem (Lepidodendron), spores
   (Lycospora), and roots (Stigmaria). Lepidodendron had leaves borne spirally on branches that
   dichotomously forked, with roots also arising spirally from the stigmarian axes, and both small
   (microspores) and large (megaspores) formed in strobili (a loose type of soft cone). Taylor and
   Taylor (1993) note that Lepidodendron reached nearly 40 meters in height, with trunks nearly 2
   meters in diameter. The trees branched extensively and produced a large number of leaves. that,
   when they fell from the branches, produced the characteristic leaf scars of the genus.

   External stem features typical of arborescent lycopods, collectively called lepidodendrids,
   based on the diamond-shaped "snakeskin" type pattern produced by the helically arranged leaf
   cushions. On the left is a lower magnification view of this type of pattern, showing the general
   features of many of these trees. Each leaf abscissed, so that if you are looking, as you are
   here, at the outside of the stem, you can see a characteristic appearance. On the right is a
   higher magnification photo showing details of leaf cushions. Each diamond shaped cushion has a
   smaller central area called the leaf base where the leaf attached. In the center of the leaf
   base you can see the leaf trace, or vein to the leaf. The vertical stripe running down each
   cushion is probably the result of increased girth from secondary cortical growth inside the
   stem. Images and text from http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/plb407/kpigg/lepidodendrid.htm, used with

   Lepidodendron was a large Carboniferous tree reaching heights of 100 feet. When the plant's
   leaves fell they left diamond-shaped scars arranged in oblique rows around the stem. Image and
   text from http://seaborg.nmu.edu/earth/carbonif/car01b.html. Note the ferns and sphenopsids
   growing around the fallen Lepidodendron trunk, and a large calamite tree in the right
   foreground.

   Sigillaria was another arborescent lycopod, and is also common in coals-age deposits. In
   contrast to the spirally borne leaves of Lepidodendron, Sigillaria had leaved arranged in
   vertical rows along the stem.

   Like the lycophytes, the sphenophytes reached their zenith during the Carboniferous and have
   declined to but a single genus, Equisetum, surviving today. The largest of the sphenophytes were
   trees placed in the genus Calamites. Numerous leaf fossils, such as the specimen of Annularia
   shown below, have been associated with these trees, as have reproductive cones. Smaller shrubby
   plants were in the genus Sphenophyllum.

   Ferns were well represented in the coal swamps. Numerous fern leaf fossils have been found,
   often the mode of preservation makes for striking fossils. Ferns ranged from small, shrubby
   forms similar to those we see in many places today, to tree-ferns, such as the Paleozoic genus
   Psaronius.

                                        [amazonpecopteris.gif]

   Pecopteris sp. is the foliage of a tree fern. Pecopteris grew on Psaronius which was one of the
   most common fossil tree ferns. Psaronius reached height of about ten meters (32 feet) and
   resembled a modern palm tree. Although common througout much of the late Paleozoic, this plant
   was most abundant in the Late Pennsylvanian and Permian. Their increasing abundance reflects
   changing climates at the close of the Paleozoic and may be related to an increase in drier
   habitats. Image and text from
   http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/mazon_creek/pecopteris.html, used with permission.

   The seed ferns underwent increases in diversity during the Carboniferous. Often the isolated
   leaf fossils are difficult to distinguish between ferns and seed ferns. Often seed ferns had the
   leaf fossil known as Neuropteris associated with the seeds.

                                       [amazonneuropteris.gif]

   Neuropteris sp. is the name given to the foliage of a seed fern. Seed ferns (Pteridospermales)
   are an extinct group of gymnosperms. Although their foliage resembled that of modern ferns, they
   reproduced by means of seeds. Modern ferns reproduce by means of spores. Image and text from
   http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/mazon_creek/neuropteris.html, used by permission.

   Other seed fern groups that characterized the Carboniferous include the medullosans and the
   cordaitaleans. During the late Carboniferous the voltzialean seed ferns appear. This latter
   group is considered by paleobotanists to be closest to the gymnosperms. Cycads, a now-minor
   group of gymnosperms but major components of the world's floras during the Mesozoic, appeared
   during the Carboniferous.

   Specimens of Cordaites, the name-bearer for the cordaitaleans, were large trees with
   strap-shaped, leathery leaves that often had parallel leaf veins. The cordaites had their
   reproductive structures and seeds arranged in cones. The cordaites had a number of growth forms
   and several different types of woody tissues have been observed in cordaite wood. The cordaites
   have been interpreted as growing in an environment like the modern bald cypress swamp.

      Animals

   The major animals on land during the Carboniferous were the amphibians (and their descendants
   such as the stem reptiles) and insects. Dragonfly fossils have been found with wingspans up to
   75 cm.

   With climate changes occurring during the late Carboniferous, the plants changed, as did the
   terrestrial animals. Glaciation in Gondwana has been blamed for this chanmge. One response that
   tetrapods made was to develop the amniotic egg. With the egg and resulting freedom from water
   for reproduction (to which amphibians to this day must return to lay their eggs) reptiles
   (sometimes known as stem-reptiles, could exploit drier environments further from water.

   Hylonomus was one of the earliest reptiles. This quadrupedal (four-legged) stem reptile ate
   insects (which were prolific in the coal swamps). From this group of early reptiles evolved the
   pelycosaurs, the great reptiles of the Carboniferous-Permian times, and posibly the bipedal
   thecodonts of the permian-Triassic. Pelycosaurs included both herbivorous and carnovorous
   species. The group was characterized by an elaborate fin or sail on their back.

    The Carboniferous World

   The Carboniferous, at least as seen in North American deposits, is really two distinct sets of
   condiions: marine dominated early Carboniferous environments charactrized by shallow seas,
   followed in time by terrestrial "coal-swamp" environments of the late Carboniferous. The
   supercontinent of Pangaea was assembled during this time, causing the uplift of seafloor as
   continental land masses collided to build the Appalachian and other mountains.

     The Carboniferous Extinction

   Glaciation in Gondwana during the late Carboniferous time contributed to decline in marine
   environments and fluctuating sealevels that alternately formed and destroyed coastal coal swamp
   environments. There appears to have been no mass extinction associated with this glaciation,
   unlike the Devonian mass extinction.

  The Permian | Back to Top

   The Permian period spanned the time interval from 286 to 245 million years ago. During the
   Permian the assembly of Pangaea was completed and a whole host of new groups of organisms
   evolved. The Permian ended in the greatest of the mass extinctions, where over 90% of all
   species were extinguished. With the assembly of pangaea and resulting mountain building, many of
   the shallow seas retreated from the continents.

    Life in the Water

   The fusulinid foraminiferans that had appeard during the Carboniferous continued their
   diversification. Trilobites were rarely encountered, although brachiopods and crinoids had some
   recovery of species diversity after the Carboniferous extinction. Marine environments were much
   restructed due to the Pangaea-related tectonism and resulting uplift of the the supercontinent.

    Life on Land

   At first glance it might appear that the only evolutionary changes of note were occurring on the
   land during the Permian. Part of this illusion results from the relative scarcity of
   Permian-aged marine sediments as well as the tendency of land-dwellers to view themselves as the
   pinacle of evolution.

   Plant life of the Permian took on an increasingly modern "look" with the rise of a number of
   gymnosperm (naked seeded) plants during the late Carboniferous and their diversification during
   the Permian. Indeed, the late Carboniferous "extinction" is almost inapplicable to terrestrial
   plants. The arborescent lycopds of the carboniferous coal swamps disappeared before the end of
   that period. The Permian saw the spread of conifers and cycads, two groups that would dominate
   the floras of the world until the Cretaceous period with the rise of the flowering plants. The
   first conifers had small leaves similar to those seen in the modern plant Auracaria, the Norfolk
   Island pine.

   Paleobotany of the Permian is also marked by an interesting group of seed ferns completely
   restricted to Gondwana, the southern parts of Pangaea. This group, the glossopterids, produced a
   distinctive leaf type (classified under the leaf-genus Glossopteris) as well as a unique,
   striated, bisaccate pollen type. Glossopteris and its associated plant organs have been found
   all over the former parts of Gondwana, the present continents of India, Australia, Africa, South
   America and Antarctica. Seeds of Glossopteris have been studied with computer simulations and
   found too large to have travelled tyhe thousands of miles of open ocean between Africa and South
   America. When Alfred Wegener proposed his continental drift hypothesis in 1912 he used fossil
   evidence like Glossopteris and its distribution to argue for the former exstence of a supoer
   continent he termed Pangaea. When the bodies of the ill-fated British expedition to the South
   Pole led by Captain Scott were found in Antarctica, leaf fossils belonging to Glossopteris were
   in the tents.

   Reconstruction of Gondwana is supported by the distribution of various fossils, such as the
   plant fossil Glossopteris. Image from http://pubs.usgs.gov/publications/text/continents.html.

   The amniote lineage (the first truly terrestrial vertebrates that did not need to return to
   water to lay eggs), especially the fossils, often are classified based on the number of openings
   in the skulls. These openings allow for muscle attachment and have traditionally been used to
   separate the "reptiles" into several groups, including the anapsids, synapsids, and diapsids.
   The anapsids, which include the turtles, lack any openings. Synapsids include the mammals and
   their predecesssor and related groups the pelycosaur (the non-mammalian synapsids). Diapsids,
   with two openings on each side of their skulls, include the birds, dinosaurs, and most of the
   traditional reptile groups. The synapsids used to be called the mammal-like reptiles. Recent
   studies suggest that many animals in this group were not so strongly reptilian (such as
   ectothermy) as the obsolete term "mammal-like reptiles" implied.

   The amniotes that had appeared during the late Carboniferous diversified from the protothyrid
   stock along two lineages: one leading to the quadrupedal pelycosaurs (stem synapsids) of the
   Carboniferous-Permian and then to the therapsids (advanced synapsids) of the Permian-Triassic;
   and the other leading to the bipedal thecodonts of the Permian-Triassic. Dimetrodon, shown
   above, was a member of the pelycosaurs, or non-mammalian therapsids. By the end of the Permian
   the therapsids had developed, a group possibly characterized by some degree of endothermy
   (warm-bloodedness). The early mammals of the Triassic period are possibly an offshoot or
   descendant group of the therapsids.

    The Permian World

   The Permian is geologically marked by the final assembly of Pangaea, glaciation in the souther
   extreme of Gondwana, and the greatest mass extinction in Earth history that occurred at the
   close of the Permian. The Permian world was marked by a nearly pole-to-pole supercontinent,
   Pangaea, that was surrounded by Panthalassa, the world sea. A small ocean, Tethys (today
   represented by the Mediterranean Sea) was also present.

  The Great Permian Extinction | Back to Top

   The end of the Permian, also the end of the Paleozoic era, was marked by the greatest extinction
   of the Phanerozoic eon. Despite its magnitude, the terminal Permian extinction has not received
   the amount of publicity or research that the more famous, but lesser, terminal Cretaceous
   extinction has. During the Permian extinction event, whose causes remain controversial, over 95%
   of marine species went extinct, while 70% of terresdtrial taxonomic familes suffered the same
   fate. The fusulinid foraminiferans went completely extinct, as did the trilobites. Brachiopod
   genera declined from 60 to 10. The majority of extinctions seem to have occurred at low
   paleolatitudes, possibly suggesting some event involving the ocean.

                                         [anextdiversity.gif]

   The major mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. Image from
   http://www.carleton.ca/~tpatters/teaching/intro/extinction/extinction1.html.

   Plants seem to have missed the great extinction. What floral changes occurred during the Permian
   occurred earlier in the period, when the gradual drying out of the continent led to the
   evolution and spread of better adapted "dry forms" such as gymnosperms and seed ferns to replace
   the swamp trees of the Carboniferous such as arborescent lycopods and sphenopsids. One major
   plant group disappeared, the swamp gymnosperm Cordaites.

   pelycosaurs

   The cause (or causes) of the Permian extinction remain in dispute.
    1. The Siberian Traps are a massive lava flow in eastern Asia that may have contributed to (or
       even caused) the Permian event by triggering a massive, sudden glaciation as well as other
       environmental consequences of volcanic eruptions. The period of greatest eruption in the
       traps coincides with the mass extinction. Ages of the lava flows suggest the traps formed
       over a one million year interval. The traps are near the city of Tura and also occur in
       Yakutsk, Noril'sk and Irkutsk, covering an area of slightly less than 2 million square
       kilometers (an area larger than Europe). The original volume of the traps is estimated at
       between 1 million and 4 million cubic km.
    2. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction that marks the close of the Mesozoic era has been
       hypothesized as a result of a large meteor or comet strike. Evidence of a similar (and
       larger) impact at the close of the Permian is not strongly supported, although some indirect
       evidence suggests an impact did occur during the Permian, although possibly not at the time
       of the extinction crisis.
    3. Climate change, possibly caused by glaciation and/or volcanic activity, has been associated
       with many mass extinctions. It seems likely that climate change is a consequence of the
       cause of extinction rather than the root cause itself.
    4. Formation of Pangaea has been invoked as a cause for the extinction. However, the formation
       of Pangaea had occurred well before the mass extinction. The mountain building and
       associated tectonism would also have been extremely long term in duration, possibly 10
       million years according to some studies of the snowball garnets from Vermont. Pangaea's
       presence may have led to extreme environments with hotter interior areas of the continent
       and colder polar areas, possibly producing glaciation.
    5. There is evidence of a sudden drop in sea level at the end of the Permian. This could be
       attributed to the sudden cooling of the climate that produced glaciers at the southern polar
       areas in Gondwana. Glacial tillites and other geological evidence of late Permian age occur
       in Australia, Siberia and in the North Sea are interpreted as proof of the existence of
       large continental glaciers at the close of the Permian.
    6. Poisoning of the ocean has been suggested due to an apparent drop in carbon isotope data
       obtained from marine sediments formed at the time of the extinction. The cause of this
       apparent dropoff in the photosynthetic rate in the seas has not yet been determined.

   Whatever cause (or combination of causes), the terminal Permain extinction was a massive and
   severe crisis for life. Many groups of organisms went extinct at that time. Surviving groups
   diversified during the Triassic period and gradually a more modern world developed.
