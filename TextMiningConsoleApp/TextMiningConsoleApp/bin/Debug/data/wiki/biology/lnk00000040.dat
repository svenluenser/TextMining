  Finding the Genes | Back to Top

   Between 1884 (the year Mendel died) and 1888 details of mitosis and meiosis were reported, the
   cell nucleus was identified as the location of the genetic material, and "qualities" were even
   proposed to be transmitted on chromosomes to daughter cells at mitosis. In 1903 Walter Sutton
   and Theodore Boveri formally proposed that chromosomes contain the genes. The Chromosome Theory
   of Inheritance is one of the foundations of genetics and explains the physical reality of
   Mendel's principles of inheritance.

                                             [92428.jpg]

   The location of many genes (Mendel's factors) was determined by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his
   coworkers in the early 1900's. Morgan's experimental organism was the fruit fly (Drosophila
   melanogaster). Fruit flies are ideal organisms for genetics, having a small size, ease of care,
   susceptibility to mutations, and short (7-9 day) generation time. The role of chromosomes in
   determination of sex was deduced by Morgan from work on fruit flies.

   During Metaphase I, homologous chromosomes will line up. A karyotype can be made by cutting and
   arranging photomicrographs of the homologous chromosomes thus revealed at Metaphase I. Two types
   of chromosome pairs occur. Autosomes resemble each other in size and placement of the
   centromere, for example pairs of chromosome 21 are the same size, while pairs of chromosome 9
   are of a different size from pair 21. Sex chromosomes may differ in their size, depending on the
   species of the organism they are from. In humans and Drosophila, males have a smaller sex
   chromosome, termed the Y, and a larger one, termed the X. Males are thus XY, and are termed
   heterogametic. Females are XX, and are termed homogametic. In grasshoppers, which Sutton studied
   in discovering chromosomes, there is no Y, only the X chromosome in males. Females are XX, while
   males are denoted as XO. Other organisms (notably birds, moths and butterflies) have males
   homogametic and females heterogametic. Males (if heterogametic) contribute either an X or Y to
   the offspring, while females contribute either X. The male thus determines the sex of the
   offspring. Remember that in meiosis, each chromosome is replicated and one copy sent to each
   gamete.

   Morgan discovered a mutant eye color and attempted to use this mutant as a recessive to
   duplicate Mendel's results. He failed, instead of achieving a 3:1 F2 ratio the ratio was closer
   to 4:1 (red to white). Most mutations are usually recessive, thus the appearance of the white
   mutant presented Morgan a chance to test Mendel's ratios on animals. The F1 generation also had
   no white eyed females. Morgan hypothesized that the gene for eye color was only on the X
   chromosome, specifically in that region of the X that had no corresponding region on the Y.
   White eyed fruit flies were also more likely to die prior to adulthood, thus explaining the
   altered ratios. Normally eyes are red, but a variant (white) eyed was detected and used in
   genetic study. Cross a homozygous white eyed male with a homozygous red eyed female, and all the
   offspring have red eyes. Red is dominant over white. However, cross a homozygous white eyed
   female with a red eyed male, and the unexpected results show all the males have white eyes and
   all the females red eyes. This can be explained if the eye color gene is on the X chromosome.

   Explanation

   If the gene for eye color is on the X chromosome, the red eyed male in the second cross will
   pass his red eyed X to only his daughters, who in turn received only a recessive white-carrying
   X from their mother. Thus all females had red eyes like their father. Since the male fruit fly
   passes only the Y to his sons, their eye color is determined entirely by the single X chromosome
   they receive from their mother (in this case white). Thus all the males in the second cross were
   white eyed.

   These experiments introduced the concept of sex-linkage, the occurrence of genes on that part of
   the X that lack a corresponding location on the Y. Sex-linked recessives (such as white eyes in
   fruit flies, hemophilia, baldness, and colorblindness in humans) occur more commonly in males,
   since there is no chance of them being heterozygous. Such a condition is termed hemizygous.

   Characteristics of X-linked Traits

   1. Phenotypic expression more common in males

   2. Sons cannot inherit the trait from their fathers, but daughters can.

   Sons inherit their Y chromosome from their father.

   Only a few genes have been identified on the Y chromosome, among them the testis-determining
   factor (TDF) that promotes development of the male phenotype.

   Barr bodies are interpreted as inactivated X chromosomes in mammalian females. Since females
   have two X chromosomes, the Lyon hypothesis suggests that one or the other X is inactivated in
   each somatic (non-reproductive) cell during embryonic development. Cells mitotically produced
   from these embryonic cells likewise have the same inactivated X chromosome.

   Calico cats (sometimes called tortoiseshell) are almost always female since the calico trait is
   caused by some areas of the cat's fur expressing one allele and others expressing the other
   color. Can there be a male tortoiseshell cat? How would such a cat get its genes? Remember that
   fur color in cats is a sex-linked feature. Would the male calico be fertile or sterile?

  The Modern View of the Gene | Back to Top

   While Mendel discussed traits, we now know that genes are segments of the DNA that code for
   specific proteins. These proteins are responsible for the expression of the phenotype. The basic
   principles of segregation and independent assortment as worked out by Mendel are applicable even
   for sex-linked traits.

    Codominant alleles

   Codominant alleles occur when rather than expressing an intermediate phenotype, the
   heterozygotes express both homozygous phenotypes. An example is in human ABO blood types, the
   heterozygote AB type manufactures antibodies to both A and B types. Blood Type A people
   manufacture only anti-B antibodies, while type B people make only anti-A antibodies. Codominant
   alleles are both expressed. Heterozygotes for codominant alleles fully express both alleles.
   Blood type AB individuals produce both A and B antigens. Since neither A nor B is dominant over
   the other and they are both dominant over O they are said to be codominant.

    Incomplete dominance

   Incomplete dominance is a condition when neither allele is dominant over the other. The
   condition is recognized by the heterozygotes expressing an intermediate phenotype relative to
   the parental phenotypes. If a red flowered plant is crossed with a white flowered one, the
   progeny will all be pink. When pink is crossed with pink, the progeny are 1 red, 2 pink, and 1
   white.

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   Flower color in snapdragons is an example of this pattern. Cross a true-breeding red strain with
   a true-breeding white strain and the F1 are all pink (heterozygotes). Self-fertilize the F1 and
   you get an F2 ratio of 1 red: 2 pink: 1 white. This would not happen if true blending had
   occurred (blending cannot explain traits such as red or white skipping a generation and pink
   flowers crossed with pink flowers should produce ONLY pink flowers).

    Multiple alleles

   Many genes have more than two alleles (even though any one diploid individual can only have at
   most two alleles for any gene), such as the ABO blood groups in humans, which are an example of
   multiple alleles. Multiple alleles result from different mutations of the same gene. Coat color
   in rabbits is determined by four alleles. Human ABO blood types are determined by alleles A, B,
   and O. A and B are codominants which are both dominant over O. The only possible genotype for a
   type O person is OO. Type A people have either AA or AO genotypes. Type B people have either BB
   or BO genotypes. Type AB have only the AB (heterozygous) genotype. The A and B alleles of gene I
   produce slightly different glycoproteins (antigens) that are on the surface of each cell.
   Homozygous A individuals have only the A antigen, homozygous B individuals have only the B
   antigen, homozygous O individuals produce neither antigen, while a fourth phenotype (AB)
   produces both A and B antigens.

  Interactions among genes | Back to Top

   While one gene may make only one protein, the effects of those proteins usually interact (for
   example widow's peak may be masked by expression of the baldness gene). Novel phenotypes often
   result from the interactions of two genes, as in the case of the comb in chickens. The single
   comb is produced only by the rrpp genotype. Rose comb (b) results from R_pp. (_ can be either R
   or r). Pea comb (c) results from rrP_. Walnut comb, a novel phenotype, is produced when the
   genotype has at least one dominant of each gene (R_P_).

    Epistasis

   Epistasis is the term applied when one gene interferes with the expression of another (as in the
   baldness/widow's peak mentioned earlier). Bateson reported a different phenotypic ratio in sweet
   pea than could be explained by simple Mendelian inheritance. This ratio is 9:7 instead of the
   9:3:3:1 one would expect of a dihybrid cross between heterozygotes. Of the two genes (C and P),
   when either is homozygous recessive (cc or pp) that gene is epistatic to (or hides) the other.
   To get purple flowers one must have both C and P alleles present.

  Environment and Gene Expression | Back to Top

   Phenotypes are always affected by their environment. In buttercup (Ranunculus peltatus), leaves
   below water-level are finely divided and those above water-level are broad, floating,
   photosynthetic leaf-like leaves. Siamese cats are darker on their extremities, due to
   temperature effects on phenotypic expression. Expression of phenotype is a result of interaction
   between genes and environment. Siamese cats and Himalayan rabbits both animals have dark colored
   fur on their extremities. This is caused by an allele that controls pigment production being
   able only to function at the lower temperatures of those extremities. Environment determines the
   phenotypic pattern of expression.

  Polygenic Inheritance | Back to Top

   Polygenic inheritance is a pattern responsible for many features that seem simple on the
   surface. Many traits such as height, shape, weight, color, and metabolic rate are governed by
   the cumulative effects of many genes. Polygenic traits are not expressed as absolute or discrete
   characters, as was the case with Mendel's pea plant traits. Instead, polygenic traits are
   recognizable by their expression as a gradation of small differences (a continuous variation).
   The results form a bell shaped curve, with a mean value and extremes in either direction.

   Height in humans is a polygenic trait, as is color in wheat kernels. Height in humans is NOT
   discontinuous. If you line up the entire class a continuum of variation is evident, with an
   average height and extremes in variation (very short [vertically challenged?] and very tall
   [vertically enhanced]). Traits showing continuous variation are usually controlled by the
   additive effects of two or more separate gene pairs. This is an example of polygenic
   inheritance. The inheritance of EACH gene follows Mendelian rules.

   Usually polygenic traits are distinguished by
    1. Traits are usually quantified by measurement rather than counting.
    2. Two or more gene pairs contribute to the phenotype.
    3. Phenotypic expression of polygenic traits varies over a wide range.

   Human polygenic traits include
    1. Height
    2. SLE (Lupus) (click here for an article about lupus and genetics)
    3. Weight (click here for an article about obesity and genetics)
    4. Eye Color (click here for an article about eye color)
    5. Intelligence
    6. Skin Color
    7. Many forms of behavior

  Pleiotropy | Back to Top

   Pleiotropy is the effect of a single gene on more than one characteristic. An example is the
   "frizzle-trait" in chickens. The primary result of this gene is the production of defective
   feathers. Secondary results are both good and bad; good include increased adaptation to warm
   temperatures, bad include increased metabolic rate, decreased egg-laying, changes in heart,
   kidney and spleen. Cats that are white with blue eyes are often deaf, white cats with a blue and
   an yellow-orange eye are deaf on the side with the blue eye. Sickle-cell anemia is a human
   disease originating in warm lowland tropical areas where malaria is common. Sickle-celled
   individuals suffer from a number of problems, all of which are pleiotropic effects of the
   sickle-cell allele.

  Genes and Chromosomes | Back to Top

   Linkage occurs when genes are on the same chromosome. Remember that sex-linked genes are on the
   X chromosome, one of the sex chromosomes. Linkage groups are invariably the same number as the
   pairs of homologous chromosomes an organism possesses. Recombination occurs when crossing-over
   has broken linkage groups, as in the case of the genes for wing size and body color that Morgan
   studied. Chromosome mapping was originally based on the frequencies of recombination between
   alleles.

   Since mutations can be induced (by radiation or chemicals), Morgan and his coworkers were able
   to cause new alleles to form by subjecting fruit flies to mutagens (agents of mutation, or
   mutation generators). Genes are located on specific regions of a certain chromosome, termed the
   gene locus (plural: loci). A gene therefore is a specific segment of the DNA molecule.

   Alfred Sturtevant, while an undergraduate student in Morgan's lab, postulated that crossing-over
   would be less common between genes adjacent to each other on the same chromosome and that it
   should be possible to plot the sequence of genes along a fruit fly chromosome by using
   crossing-over frequencies. Distances on gene maps are expressed in map units (one map unit = 1
   recombinant per 100 fertilized eggs; or a 1% chance of recombination).

   The map for Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes is well known (click here to view the main map).
   Note that eye color and aristae length are far apart, as indicated by the occurrence of more
   recombinants (crossing-overs) between them, while wing length is closer to eye shape (as
   indicated by the low frequency of recombination between these two features).

   Figure A illustrates the fruit fly chromosomes at metaphase; figure B shows a polytene
   chromosome. The above image is from Around the Genome (at
   http://fly2.berkeley.edu/BDGP/publications/Around_the_Genomes.html).

  Chromosome Abnormalities | Back to Top

   Chromosome abnormalities include inversion, insertion, duplication, and deletion. These are
   types of mutations. Since DNA is information, and information typically has a beginning point,
   an inversion would produce an inactive or altered protein. Likewise deletion or duplication will
   alter the gene product.
