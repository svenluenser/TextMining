   Life exhibits varying degrees of organization. Atoms are organized into molecules, molecules
   into organelles, and organelles into cells, and so on. According to the Cell Theory, all living
   things are composed of one or more cells, and the functions of a multicellular organism are a
   consequence of the types of cells it has. Cells fall into two broad groups: prokaryotes and
   eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells are smaller (as a general rule) and lack much of the internal
   compartmentalization and complexity of eukaryotic cells. No matter which type of cell we are
   considering, all cells have certain features in common, such as a cell membrane, DNA and RNA,
   cytoplasm, and ribosomes. Eukaryotic cells have a great variety of organelles and structures.

Cell Size and Shape | Back to Top

   The shapes of cells are quite varied with some, such as neurons, being longer than they are wide
   and others, such as parenchyma (a common type of plant cell) and erythrocytes (red blood cells)
   being equidimensional. Some cells are encased in a rigid wall, which constrains their shape,
   while others have a flexible cell membrane (and no rigid cell wall).

   The size of cells is also related to their functions. Eggs (or to use the latin word, ova) are
   very large, often being the largest cells an organism produces. The large size of many eggs is
   related to the process of development that occurs after the egg is fertilized, when the contents
   of the egg (now termed a zygote) are used in a rapid series of cellular divisions, each
   requiring tremendous amounts of energy that is available in the zygote cells. Later in life the
   energy must be acquired, but at first a sort of inheritance/trust fund of energy is used.

   Cells range in size from small bacteria to large, unfertilized eggs laid by birds and dinosaurs.
   The realtive size ranges of biological things is shown in Figure 1. In science we use the metric
   system for measuring. Here are some measurements and convesrions that will aid your
   understanding of biology.

   1 meter = 100 cm = 1,000 mm = 1,000,000 µm = 1,000,000,000 nm

   1 centimenter (cm) = 1/100 meter = 10 mm

   1 millimeter (mm) = 1/1000 meter = 1/10 cm

   1 micrometer (µm) = 1/1,000,000 meter = 1/10,000 cm

   1 nanometer (nm) = 1/1,000,000,000 meter = 1/10,000,000 cm

The Cell Membrane | Back to Top

   The cell membrane functions as a semi-permeable barrier, allowing a very few molecules across it
   while fencing the majority of organically produced chemicals inside the cell. Electron
   microscopic examinations of cell membranes have led to the development of the lipid bilayer
   model (also referred to as the fluid-mosaic model). The most common molecule in the model is the
   phospholipid, which has a polar (hydrophilic) head and two nonpolar (hydrophobic) tails. These
   phospholipids are aligned tail to tail so the nonpolar areas form a hydrophobic region between
   the hydrophilic heads on the inner and outer surfaces of the membrane. This layering is termed a
   bilayer since an electron microscopic technique known as freeze-fracturing is able to split the
   bilayer, shown in Figure 2.

                                             [01967a.jpg]

   Cholesterol is another important component of cell membranes embedded in the hydrophobic areas
   of the inner (tail-tail) region. Most bacterial cell membranes do not contain cholesterol.
   Cholesterol aids in the flexibility of a cell membrane.

   Proteins, shown in Figure 2, are suspended in the inner layer, although the more hydrophilic
   areas of these proteins "stick out" into the cells interior as well as outside the cell. These
   proteins function as gateways that will allow certain molecules to cross into and out of the
   cell by moving through open areas of the protein channel. These integral proteins are sometimes
   known as gateway proteins. The outer surface of the membrane will tend to be rich in
   glycolipids, which have their hydrophobic tails embedded in the hydrophobic region of the
   membrane and their heads exposed outside the cell. These, along with carbohydrates attached to
   the integral proteins, are thought to function in the recognition of self, a sort of cellular
   identification system.

   The contents (both chemical and organelles) of the cell are termed protoplasm, and are further
   subdivided into cytoplasm (all of the protoplasm except the contents of the nucleus) and
   nucleoplasm (all of the material, plasma and DNA etc., within the nucleus).

The Cell Wall | Back to Top

   Not all living things have cell walls, most notably animals and many of the more animal-like
   protistans. Bacteria have cell walls containing the chemical peptidoglycan. Plant cells, shown
   in Figures 3 and 4, have a variety of chemicals incorporated in their cell walls. Cellulose, a
   nondigestible (to humans anyway) polysaccharide is the most common chemical in the plant primary
   cell wall. Some plant cells also have lignin and other chemicals embedded in their secondary
   walls.

   The cell wall is located outside the plasma membrane. Plasmodesmata are connections through
   which cells communicate chemically with each other through their thick walls. Fungi and many
   protists have cell walls although they do not contain cellulose, rather a variety of chemicals
   (chitin for fungi).

   Animal cells, shown in Figure 5, lack a cell wall, and must instead rely on their cell membrane
   to maintain the integrity of the cell. Many protistans also lack cell walls, using variously
   modified cell membranes o act as a boundary to the inside of the cell.

The nucleus | Back to Top

   The nucleus, shown in Figures 6 and 7, occurs only in eukaryotic cells. It is the location for
   most of the nucleic acids a cell makes, such as DNA and RNA. Danish biologist Joachim Hammerling
   carried out an important experiment in 1943. His work (click here for a diagram) showed the role
   of the nucleus in controlling the shape and features of the cell. Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, is
   the physical carrier of inheritance and with the exception of plastid DNA (cpDNA and mDNA, found
   in the chloroplast and mitochondrion respectively) all DNA is restricted to the nucleus.
   Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is formed in the nucleus using the DNA base sequence as a template. RNA
   moves out into the cytoplasm where it functions in the assembly of proteins. The nucleolus is an
   area of the nucleus (usually two nucleoli per nucleus) where ribosomes are constructed.

   Figure 6. Structure of the nucleus. Note the chromatin, uncoiled DNA that occupies the space
   within the nuclear envelope. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th

   The nuclear envelope, shown in Figure 8, is a double-membrane structure. Numerous pores occur in
   the envelope, allowing RNA and other chemicals to pass, but the DNA not to pass.

Cytoplasm | Back to Top

   The cytoplasm was defined earlier as the material between the plasma membrane (cell membrane)
   and the nuclear envelope. Fibrous proteins that occur in the cytoplasm, referred to as the
   cytoskeleton maintain the shape of the cell as well as anchoring organelles, moving the cell and
   controlling internal movement of structures. Elements that comprose the cytoskeleton are shown
   in Figure 10. Microtubules function in cell division and serve as a "temporary scaffolding" for
   other organelles. Actin filaments are thin threads that function in cell division and cell
   motility. Intermediate filaments are between the size of the microtubules and the actin
   filaments.

Vacuoles and vesicles | Back to Top

   Vacuoles are single-membrane organelles that are essentially part of the outside that is located
   within the cell. The single membrane is known in plant cells as a tonoplast. Many organisms will
   use vacuoles as storage areas. Vesicles are much smaller than vacuoles and function in
   transporting materials both within and to the outside of the cell.

Ribosomes | Back to Top

   Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis. They are not membrane-bound and thus occur in both
   prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Eukaryotic ribosomes are slightly larger than prokaryotic ones.
   Structurally, the ribosome consists of a small and larger subunit, as shown in Figure 11. .
   Biochemically, the ribosome consists of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and some 50 structural proteins.
   Often ribosomes cluster on the endoplasmic reticulum, in which case they resemble a series of
   factories adjoining a railroad line. Figure 12 illustrates the many ribosomes attached to the
   endoplasmic reticulum. Click here for Ribosomes (More than you ever wanted to know about
   ribosomes!)

Endoplasmic reticulum | Back to Top

   Endoplasmic reticulum, shown in Figure 13 and 14, is a mesh of interconnected membranes that
   serve a function involving protein synthesis and transport. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (Rough
   ER) is so-named because of its rough appearance due to the numerous ribosomes that occur along
   the ER. Rough ER connects to the nuclear envelope through which the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is
   the blueprint for proteins travels to the ribosomes. Smooth ER; lacks the ribosomes
   characteristic of Rough ER and is thought to be involved in transport and a variety of other
   functions.

Golgi Apparatus and Dictyosomes | Back to Top

   Golgi Complexes, shown in Figure 15 and 16, are flattened stacks of membrane-bound sacs. Italian
   biologist Camillo Golgi discovered these structures in the late 1890s, although their precise
   role in the cell was not deciphered until the mid-1900s . Golgi function as a packaging plant,
   modifying vesicles produced by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. New membrane material is
   assembled in various cisternae (layers) of the golgi.

Lysosomes | Back to Top

   Lysosomes, shown in Figure 17, are relatively large vesicles formed by the Golgi. They contain
   hydrolytic enzymes that could destroy the cell. Lysosome contents function in the extracellular
   breakdown of materials.

Mitochondria | Back to Top

   Mitochondria contain their own DNA (termed mDNA) and are thought to represent bacteria-like
   organisms incorporated into eukaryotic cells over 700 million years ago (perhaps even as far
   back as 1.5 billion years ago). They function as the sites of energy release (following
   glycolysis in the cytoplasm) and ATP formation (by chemiosmosis). The mitochondrion has been
   termed the powerhouse of the cell. Mitochondria are bounded by two membranes. The inner membrane
   folds into a series of cristae, which are the surfaces on which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is
   generated. The matrix is the area of the mitochondrion surrounded by the inner mitochondrial
   membrane. Ribosomes and mitochondrial DNA are found in the matrix. The significance of these
   features will be discussed below. The structure of mitochondria is shown in Figure 18 and 19.

   Figure 18. Structure of a mitochondrion. Note the various infoldings of the mitochondrial inner
   membrane that produce the cristae. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th

    Mitochondria and endosymbiosis

   During the 1980s, Lynn Margulis proposed the theory of endosymbiosis to explain the origin of
   mitochondria and chloroplasts from permanent resident prokaryotes. According to this idea, a
   larger prokaryote (or perhaps early eukaryote) engulfed or surrounded a smaller prokaryote some
   1.5 billion to 700 million years ago. Steps in this sequence are illustrated in Figure 20.

   Figure 20. The basic events in endosymbiosis. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of
   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                           [endosymbio.gif]

   Instead of digesting the smaller organisms the large one and the smaller one entered into a type
   of symbiosis known as mutualism, wherein both organisms benefit and neither is harmed. The
   larger organism gained excess ATP provided by the "protomitochondrion" and excess sugar provided
   by the "protochloroplast", while providing a stable environment and the raw materials the
   endosymbionts required. This is so strong that now eukaryotic cells cannot survive without
   mitochondria (likewise photosynthetic eukaryotes cannot survive without chloroplasts), and the
   endosymbionts can not survive outside their hosts. Nearly all eukaryotes have mitochondria.
   Mitochondrial division is remarkably similar to the prokaryotic methods that will be studied
   later in this course. A summary of the theory is available by clicking here.

Plastids | Back to Top

   Plastids are also membrane-bound organelles that only occur in plants and photosynthetic
   eukaryotes. Leucoplasts, also known as amyloplasts (and shown in Figure 21) store starch, as
   well as sometimes protein or oils. Chromoplasts store pigments associated with the bright colors
   of flowers and/or fruits.

   Figure 21. Starch grains ina fresh-cut potato tuber. Image from
   http://images.botany.org/set-13/13-008v.jpg.

                                           [amyloplast.jpg]

   Chloroplasts, illustrated in Figures 22 and 23, are the sites of photosynthesis in eukaryotes.
   They contain chlorophyll, the green pigment necessary for photosynthesis to occur, and
   associated accessory pigments (carotenes and xanthophylls) in photosystems embedded in
   membranous sacs, thylakoids (collectively a stack of thylakoids are a granum [plural = grana])
   floating in a fluid termed the stroma. Chloroplasts contain many different types of accessory
   pigments, depending on the taxonomic group of the organism being observed.

    Chloroplasts and endosymbiosis

   Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own DNA, termed cpDNA. Chloroplasts of Green Algae
   (Protista) and Plants (descendants of some of the Green Algae) are thought to have originated by
   endosymbiosis of a prokaryotic alga similar to living Prochloron (the sole genus present in the
   Prochlorobacteria, shown in Figure 24). Chloroplasts of Red Algae (Protista) are very similar
   biochemically to cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green bacteria [algae to chronologically
   enhanced folks like myself :)]). Endosymbiosis is also invoked for this similarity, perhaps
   indicating more than one endosymbiotic event occurred.

   Figure 24. Prochloron, a photosynthetic bacteria, reveals the presence of numerous thylakoids in
   the transmission electron micrograph on the left. Prochloron occurs in long filaments, as shown
   by the light micrograph on the right below. Image from

Cell Movement | Back to Top

   Cell movement; is both internal, referred to as cytoplasmic streaming, and external, referred to
   as motility. Internal movements of organelles are governed by actin filaments and other
   components of the cytoskeleton. These filaments make an area in which organelles such as
   chloroplasts can move. Internal movement is known as cytoplasmic streaming. External movement of
   cells is determined by special organelles for locomotion.

   The cytoskeleton is a network of connected filaments and tubules. It extends from the nucleus to
   the plasma membrane. Electron microscopic studies showed the presence of an organized cytoplasm.
   Immunofluorescence microscopy identifies protein fibers as a major part of this cellular
   feature. The cytoskeleton components maintain cell shape and allow the cell and its organelles
   to move.

   Actin filaments, shown in Figure 25, are long, thin fibers approximately seven nm in diameter.
   These filaments occur in bundles or meshlike networks. These filaments are polar, meaning there
   are differences between the ends of the strand. An actin filament consists of two chains of
   globular actin monomers twisted to form a helix. Actin filaments play a structural role, forming
   a dense complex web just under the plasma membrane. Actin filaments in microvilli of intestinal
   cells act to shorten the cell and thus to pull it out of the intestinal lumen. Likewise, the
   filaments can extend the cell into intestine when food is to be absorbed. In plant cells, actin
   filaments form tracts along which chloroplasts circulate.

   Actin filaments move by interacting with myosin, The myosin combines with and splits ATP, thus
   binding to actin and changing the configuration to pull the actin filament forward. Similar
   action accounts for pinching off cells during cell division and for amoeboid movement.

   Figure 25. Skeletal muscle fiber with exposed intracellular actin myosin filaments. The muscle
   fiber was cut perpendicular to its length to expose the intracellular actin myosin filaments.

                                            [20640Bv.jpg]

   Intermediate filaments are between eight and eleven nm in diameter. They are between actin
   filaments and microtubules in size. The intermediate fibers are rope-like assemblies of fibrous
   polypeptides. Some of them support the nuclear envelope, while others support the plasma
   membrane, form cell-to-cell junctions.

   Microtubules are small hollow cylinders (25 nm in diameter and from 200 nm-25 µm in length).
   These microtubules are composed of a globular protein tubulin. Assembly brings the two types of
   tubulin (alpha and beta) together as dimers, which arrange themselves in rows.

   In animal cells and most protists, a structure known as a centrosome occurs. The centrosome
   contains two centrioles lying at right angles to each other. Centrioles are short cylinders with
   a 9 + 0 pattern of microtubule triplets. Centrioles serve as basal bodies for cilia and
   flagella. Plant and fungal cells have a structure equivalent to a centrosome, although it does
   not contain centrioles.

   Cilia are short, usually numerous, hairlike projections that can move in an undulating fashion
   (e.g., the protzoan Paramecium, the cells lining the human upper respiratory tract). Flagella
   are longer, usually fewer in number, projections that move in whip-like fashion (e.g., sperm
   cells). Cilia and flagella are similar except for length, cilia being much shorter. They both
   have the characteristic 9 + 2 arrangement of microtubules shown in figures 26.

   Figure 26. Cilia from an epithelial cell in cross section (TEM x199,500). Note the 9 + 2
   arrangement of cilia. This image is copyright Dennis Kunkel at www.DennisKunkel.com, used with

                                             [63589a.jpg]

   Cilia and flagella move when the microtubules slide past one another. Both oif these locomotion
   structures have a basal body at base with thesame arrangement of microtubule triples as
   centrioles. Cilia and flagella grow by the addition of tubulin dimers to their tips.

   Flagella work as whips pulling (as in Chlamydomonas or Halosphaera) or pushing (dinoflagellates,
   a group of single-celled Protista) the organism through the water. Cilia work like oars on a
   viking longship (Paramecium has 17,000 such oars covering its outer surface). The movement of
   these structures is shown in Figure 27.

                                            [cilflag.gif]

   Not all cells use cilia or flagella for movement. Some, such as Amoeba, Chaos (Pelomyxa) and
   human leukocytes (white blood cells), employ pseudopodia to move the cell. Unlike cilia and
   flagella, pseudopodia are not structures, but rather are associated with actin near the moving
   edge of the cell. The formation of a pseudopod is shown in Figure 28.

     * Give the function and cellular location of the following basic eukaryotic organelles and
       structures: cell membrane, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies, lysosomes,
       mitochondria, ribosomes, chloroplasts, vacuoles, and cell walls.
     * A micrometer is one-millionth of a meter long. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter long.
       How many micrometers tall are you?
     * Describe the function of the nuclear envelope and nucleolus.
     * Describe the details of the structure of the chloroplast, the site of photosynthesis.
     * Mature, living plant cells often have a large, fluid-filled central vacuole that can store
       amino acids, sugars, ions, and toxic wastes. Animal cells generally lack large vacuoles. How
       do animal cells perform these functions?
     * Microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments are all main components of the
       cytoskeleton.
     * Flagella and cilia propel eukaryotic cells through their environment; the microtubule
       organization in these organelles is a 9+2 array.
