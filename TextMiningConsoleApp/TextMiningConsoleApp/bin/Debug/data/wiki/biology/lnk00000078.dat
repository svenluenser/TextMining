Ecology | Back to Top

   In previous chapters/units we have concentrated on the biology of the individual cell, tissue,
   and organism. There are levels of organization above the individual organism that will be the
   subject of this unit. Individual organisms are grouped into populations, which in turn form
   communities, which form ecosystems. Ecosystems make up the biosphere, which includes all life on
   Earth. If there is life on other planets, will we need another level of organization?

   Biosphere: The sum of all living things taken in conjunction with their environment. In essence,
   where life occurs, from the upper reaches of the atmosphere to the top few meters of soil, to
   the bottoms of the oceans. We divide the earth into atmosphere (air), lithosphere (earth),
   hydrosphere (water), and biosphere (life).

   Ecosystem: The relationships of a smaller groups of organisms with each other and their
   environment. Scientists often speak of the interrelatedness of living things. Since, according
   to Darwin's theory, organisms adapt to their environment, they must also adapt to other
   organisms in that environment. We can discuss the flow of energy through an ecosystem from
   photosynthetic autotrophs to herbivores to carnivores.

   Community: The relationships between groups of different species. For example, the desert
   communities consist of rabbits, coyotes, snakes, birds, mice and such plants as sahuaro cactus
   (Carnegia gigantea), Ocotillo, creosote bush, etc. Community structure can be disturbed by such
   things as fire, human activity, and over-population.

   Species: Groups of similar individuals who tend to mate and produce viable, fertile offspring.
   We often find species described not by their reproduction (a biological species) but rather by
   their form (anatomical or form species).

   Populations: Groups of similar individuals who tend to mate with each other in a limited
   geographic area. This can be as simple as a field of flowers, which is separated from another
   field by a hill or other area where none of these flowers occur.

   Individuals: One or more cells characterized by a unique arrangement of DNA "information". These
   can be unicellular or multicellular. The multicellular individual exhibits specialization of
   cell types and division of labor into tissues, organs, and organ systems.

   Organ System: (in multicellular organisms). A group of cells, tissues, and organs that perform a
   specific major function. For example: the cardiovascular system functions in circulation of
   blood.

   Organ: (in multicellular organisms). A group of cells or tissues performing an overall function.
   For example: the heart is an organ that pumps blood within the cardiovascular system.

   Tissue: (in multicellular organisms). A group of cells performing a specific function. For
   example heart muscle tissue is found in the heart and its unique contraction properties aid the
   heart's functioning as a pump. .

   Cell: The fundamental unit of living things. Each cell has some sort of hereditary material
   (either DNA or more rarely RNA), energy acquiring chemicals, structures, etc. Living things, by
   definition, must have the metabolic chemicals plus a nucleic acid hereditary information
   molecule.

   Organelle: A subunit of a cell, an organelle is involved in a specific subcellular function, for
   example the ribosome (the site of protein synthesis) or mitochondrion (the site of ATP
   generation in eukaryotes).

   Molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles: The fundamental functional levels of biochemistry.

   It is thus possible to study biology at many levels, from collections of organisms
   (communities), to the inner workings of a cell (organelle).

   Ecology is the study how organisms interact with each other and their physical environment.
   These interactions are often quite complex. Human activity frequently disturbs living systems
   and affects these interactions. Ecological predictions are, of a consequence, often more general
   than we would like.

Population Growth | Back to Top

   A population is a group of individuals of the same species living in the same geographic area.
   The study of factors that affect growth, stability, and decline of populations is population
   dynamics. All populations undergo three distinct phases of their life cycle:
    1. growth
    2. stability
    3. decline

   Population growth occurs when available resources exceed the number of individuals able to
   exploit them. Reproduction is rapid, and death rates are low, producing a net increase in the
   population size.

   Population stability is often proceeded by a "crash" since the growing population eventually
   outstrips its available resources. Stability is usually the longest phase of a population's life
   cycle.

   Decline is the decrease in the number of individuals in a population, and eventually leads to
   population extinction.

  Factors Influencing Population Growth

   Nearly all populations will tend to grow exponentially as long as there are resources available.
   Most populations have the potential to expand at an exponential rate, since reproduction is
   generally a multiplicative process. Two of the most basic factors that affect the rate of
   population growth are the birth rate, and the death rate. The intrinsic rate of increase is the
   birth rate minus the death rate.

   [expgrowth.gif]

   Two modes of population growth. The Exponential curve (also known as a J-curve) occurs when
   there is no limit to population size. The Logistic curve (also known as an S-curve) shows the
   effect of a limiting factor (in this case the carrying capacity of the environment). Image from
   Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates
   (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

  Population Growth Potential Is Related to Life History

   The age within it's individual life cycle at which an organism reproduces affects the rate of
   population increase. Life history refers to the age of sexual maturity, age of death, and other
   events in that individual's lifetime that influence reproductive traits. Some organisms grow
   fast, reproduce quickly, and have abundant offspring each reproductive cycle. Other organisms
   grow slowly, reproduce at a late age, and have few offspring per cycle. Most organisms are
   intermediate to these two extremes.

                                           [LifeHist_1.gif]

   Age structure refers to the relative proportion of individuals in each age group of a
   population. Populations with more individuals aged at or before reproductive age have a
   pyramid-shaped age structure graph, and can expand rapidly as the young mature and breed. Stable
   populations have relatively the same numbers in each of the age classes.

   Human populations are in a growth phase. Since evolving about 200,000 years ago, our species has
   proliferated and spread over the Earth. Beginning in 1650, the slow population increases of our
   species exponentially increased. New technologies for hunting and farming have enabled this
   expansion. It took 1800 years to reach a total population of 1 billion, but only 130 years to
   reach 2 billion, and a mere 45 years to reach 4 billion.

   Despite technological advances, factors influencing population growth will eventually limit
   expansion of human population. These will involve limitation of physical and biological
   resources as world population increased to over six billion in 1999. The 1987 population was
   estimated at a puny 5 billion.

  Populations Transition Between Growth and Stability

   Limits on population growth can include food supply, space, and complex interactions with other
   physical and biological factors (including other species). After an initial period of
   exponential growth, a population will encounter a limiting factor that will cause the
   exponential growth to stop. The population enters a slower growth phase and may eventually
   stabilize at a fairly constant population size within some range of fluctuation. This model fits
   the logistic growth model. The carrying capacity is the point where population size levels off.

                                            [carrycap.gif]

  Several Basic Controls Govern Population Size

   The environment is the ultimate cause of population stabilization. Two categories of factors are
   commonly used: physical environment and biological environment. Three subdivisions of the
   biological environment are competition, predation, and symbiosis.

   Physical environment factors include food, shelter, water supply, space availability, and (for
   plants) soil and light. One of these factors may severely limit population size, even if the
   others are not as constrained. The Law of the Minimum states that population growth is limited
   by the resource in the shortest supply.

   The biological role played by a species in the environment is called a niche.
   Organisms/populations in competition have a niche overlap of a scarce resource for which they
   compete. Competitive exclusion occurs between two species when competition is so intense that
   one species completely eliminates the second species from an area. In nature this is rather
   rare. While owls and foxes may compete for a common food source, there are alternate sources of
   food available. Niche overlap is said to be minimal.

   Paramecium aurelia has a population nearly twice as large when it does not have to share its
   food source with a competing species. Competitive release occurs when the competing species is
   no longer present and its constraint on the winner's population size is removed.

   prospers (yop two graphs), when they are in a competition situation one species will win, the
   other will lose (bottom graph). Images from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th
   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with
   permission..

   Predators kill and consume other organisms. Carnivores prey on animals, herbivores consume
   plants. Predators usually limit the prey population, although in extreme cases they can drive
   the prey to extinction. There are three major reasons why predators rarely kill and eat all the
   prey:
    1. Prey species often evolve protective mechanisms such as camouflage, poisons, spines, or
       large size to deter predation.
    2. Prey species often have refuges where the predators cannot reach them.
    3. Often the predator will switch its prey as the prey species becomes lower in abundance: prey
       switching.

   effects of declines in the wolf population in the late 1960s and again in the early 1980s on the
   moose population. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by
   Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   Symbiosis has come to include all species interactions besides predation and competition.
   Mutualism is a symbiosis where both parties benefit, for example algae (zooxanthellae) inside
   reef-building coral. Parasitism is a symbiosis where one species benefits while harming the
   other. Parasites act more slowly than predators and often do not kill their host. Commensalism
   is a symbiosis where one species benefits and the other is neither harmed nor gains a benefit:
   Spanish moss on trees, barnacles on crab shells. Amensalism is a symbiosis where members of one
   population inhibit the growth of another while being unaffected themselves.

  The Real World Has a Complex Interaction of Population Controls

   Natural populations are not governed by a single control, but rather have the combined effects
   of many controls simultaneously playing roles in determining population size. If two beetle
   species interact in the laboratory, one result occurs; if a third species is introduced, a
   different outcome develops. The latter situation is more like nature, and changes in one
   population may have a domino effect on others.

   Which factors, if either, is more important in controlling population growth: physical or
   biological? Physical factors may play a dominant role, and are called density independent
   regulation, since population density is not a factor The other extreme has biological factors
   dominant, and is referred to as density dependent regulation, since population density is a
   factor. It seems likely that one or the other extreme may dominate in some environments, with
   most environments having a combination control.

    Population Decline and Extinction

   Extinction is the elimination of all individuals in a group. Local extinction is the loss of all
   individuals in a population. Species extinction occurs when all members of a species and its
   component populations go extinct. Scientists estimate that 99% of all species that ever existed
   are now extinct. The ultimate cause of decline and extinction is environmental change. Changes
   in one of the physical factors of the environment may cause the decline and extinction; likewise
   the fossil record indicates that some extinctions are caused by migration of a competitor.

   Dramatic declines in human population happen periodically in response to an infectious disease.
   Bubonic plague infections killed half of Europe's population between 1346 and 1350, later
   plagues until 1700 killed one quarter of the European populace. Smallpox and other diseases
   decimated indigenous populations in North and South America.

    Human Impact

   Human populations have continued to increase, due to use of technology that has disrupted
   natural populations. Destabilization of populations leads to possible outcomes:
     * population growth as previous limits are removed
     * population decline as new limits are imposed

   Agriculture and animal domestication are examples of population increase of favored organisms.
   In England alone more than 300,000 cats are put to sleep per year, yet before their
   domestication, the wild cat ancestors were rare and probably occupied only a small area in the
   Middle East.

    Pollution

   Pollutants generally are (unplanned?) releases of substances into the air and water. Many lakes
   often have nitrogen and phosphorous as limiting nutrients for aquatic and terrestrial plants.
   Runoff from agricultural fertilizers increases these nutrients, leading to runaway plant growth,
   or eutrophication. Increased plant populations eventually lead to increased bacterial
   populations that reduce oxygen levels in the water, causing fish and other organisms to
   suffocate.

    Pesticides and Competition

   Removal of a competing species can cause the ecological release of a population explosion in
   that species competitor. Pesticides sprayed on wheat fields often result in a secondary pest
   outbreak as more-tolerant-to-pesticide species expand once less tolerant competitors are
   removed.

    Removal of Predators

   Predator release is common where humans hunt, trap, or otherwise reduce predator populations,
   allowing the prey population to increase. Elimination of wolves and panthers have led to
   increase in their natural prey: deer. There are more deer estimated in the United States than
   there were when Europeans arrived. Large deer populations often cause over grazing that in turn
   leads to starvation of the deer.

    Introduction of New Species

   Introduction of exotic or alien non-native species into new areas is perhaps the greatest single
   factor to affect natural populations. More than 1500 exotic insect species and more than 25
   families of alien fish have been introduced into North America; in excess of 3000 plant species
   have also been introduced. The majority of accidental introductions may fail, however, once an
   introduced species becomes established, its population growth is explosive. Kudzu, a plant
   introduced to the American south from Japan, has taken over large areas of the countryside.

Altering Population Growth | Back to Top

   Humans can remove or alter the constraints on population sizes, with both good and bad
   consequences. On the negative side, about 17% of the 1500 introduced insect species require the
   use of pesticides to control them. For example, African killer bees are expanding their
   population and migrating from northward from South America. These killer bees are much more
   agressive than the natives, and destroy native honeybee populations.

   On a positive note, human-induced population explosions can provide needed resources for growing
   human populations. Agriculture now produces more food per acre, allowing and sustaining
   increased human population size.

   Human action is causing the extinction of species at thousands of times the natural rate.
   Extinction is caused by alteration of a population's environment in a harmful way. Habitat
   disruption is the disturbance of the physical environment of a species, for example cutting a
   forest or draining wetlands. Habitat disruption in currently the leading cause of extinction.

   Changes in the biological environment occur in three ways.
    1. Species introduction: An exotic species is introduced into an area where it may have no
       predfators to control its population size, or where it can gratly out compete native
       organisms. Examples include zebra mussels introduced into Lake Erie, and lake trout released
       into Yellowstone Lake where they are threatening the native cutthroat trout populations.
    2. Overhunting: When a predator population increases or becomes more efficient at killing the
       prey, the prey population may decline or go extinct. Examples today include big game
       hunting, which has in many places reduced the predator (or in this case prey) population. In
       human prehistory we may have caused the extinction of the mammoths and mastodons due to
       increased human hunting skill.
    3. Secondary extinction: Loss of food species can cause migration or extinction of any species
       that depends largely or solely on that species as a food source.

   Overkill is the shooting, trapping, or hunting of a species usually for sport or economic
   reasons. Unfortunately, this cannot eliminate "pest" species like cockroaches and mice due to
   their large population sizes and capacity to reproduce more rapidly than we can eliminate them.
   However, many large animals have been eliminated or had their populations drastically reduced
   (such as tigers, elephants, and leopards).

   The death of one species or population can cause the decline or elimination of others, a process
   known as secondary extinction. Destruction of bamboo forests in China, the food for the giant
   panda, may cause the extinction of the panda. The extinction of the dodo bird has caused the
   Calviera tree to become unable to reproduce since the dodo ate the fruit and processed the seeds
   of that tree.

  Populations Have a Minimum Viable Size

   Even if a number of individuals survive, the population size may become too small for the
   species to continue. Small populations may have breeding problems. They are susceptible to
   random environmental fluctuations and genetic drift to a greater degree than are larger
   populations. The chance of extinction increases exponentially with decreasing population size.

   The minimum viable population (MVP) is the smallest population size that can avoid extinction by
   the two reasons listed above. If no severe environmental fluxes develop for a long enough time,
   a small population will recover. The MVP depends heavily on reproductive rates of the species.

Range and Density | Back to Top

   Populations tend to have a maximum density near the center of their geographic range. Geographic
   range is the total area occupied by the species. Outlying zones, where conditions are less
   optimal, include the zone of physiological stress (where individuals are rare), and eventually
   the zone of intolerance (where individuals are not found).

   The environment is usually never uniform enough to support uniform distribution of a species.
   Species thus have a dispersion pattern. Three patterns found include uniform, clumped, and
   random.

   Geographic ranges of species are dynamic, over time they can contract or expand due to
   environmental change or human activity. Often a species will require another species' presence,
   for example Drosophila in Hawaii. Species ranges can also expand due to human actions: brown
   trout are now found worldwide because of the sprerad of trout fishing.
