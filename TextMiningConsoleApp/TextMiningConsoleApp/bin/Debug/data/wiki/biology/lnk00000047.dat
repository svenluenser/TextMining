   A hormone is any chemical produced in one part of the body that has a target elsewhere in the
   body. Plants have five classes of hormones. Animals, especially chordates, have a much larger
   number. Hormones and enzymes serve as control chemicals in multicellular organisms. One
   important aspect of this is the obtaining of food and/or nutrients

  Auxins | Back to Top

   Auxins promote stem elongation, inhibit growth of lateral buds (maintains apical dominance).
   They are produced in the stem, buds, and root tips. Example: Indole Acetic Acid (IA). Auxin is a
   plant hormone produced in the stem tip that promotes cell elongation. Auxin moves to the darker
   side of the plant, causing the cells there to grow larger than corresponding cells on the
   lighter side of the plant. This produces a curving of the plant stem tip toward the light, a
   plant movement known as phototropism.

   Auxin also plays a role in maintaining apical dominance. Most plants have lateral (sometimes
   called axillary) buds located at nodes (where leaves attach to the stem). Buds are embryonic
   meristems maintained in a dormant state. Auxin maintains this dormancy. As long as sufficient
   auxin is produced by the apical meristem, the lateral buds remain dormant. If the apex of the
   shoot is removed (by a browsing animal or a scientist), the auxin is no longer produced. This
   will cause the lateral buds to break their dormancy and begin to grow. In effect, the plant
   becomes bushier. When a gardener trims a hedge, they are applying apical dominance.

  Gibberellins | Back to Top

   Gibberellins promote stem elongation. They are not produced in stem tip. Gibberellic acid was
   the first of this class of hormone to be discovered.

  Cytokinins | Back to Top

   Cytokinins promote cell division. They are produced in growing areas, such as meristems at tip
   of the shoot. Zeatin is a hormone in this class, and occurs in corn (Zea ).

  Abscisic Acid | Back to Top

   Abscisic Acid promotes seed dormancy by inhibiting cell growth. It is also involved in opening
   and closing of stomata as leaves wilt.

  Ethylene | Back to Top

   Ethylene is a gas produced by ripe fruits. Why does one bad apple spoil the whole bunch?
   Ethylene is used to ripen crops at the same time. Sprayed on a field it will cause all fruits to
   ripen at the same time so they can be harvested.

  Plant Nutrition | Back to Top

   Unlike animals (which obrtain their food from what they eat) plants obtain their nutrition from
   the soil and atmosphere. Using sunlight as an energy source, plants are capable of making all
   the organic macromolecules they need by modifications of the sugars they form by photosynthesis.
   However, plants must take up various minerals through their root systems for use.

    A (plant) balanced diet

   Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen are considered the essential elements. Nitrogen, Potassium, and
   Phosphorous are obtained from the soil and are the primary macronutrients. Calcium, Magnesium,
   and Sulfur are the secondary macronutrients needed in lesser quantity. The micronutrients,
   needed in very small quantities and toxic in large quantities, include Iron, Manganese, Copper,
   Zinc, Boron, and Chlorine. A complete fertilizer provides all three primary macronutrients and
   some of the secondary and micronutrients. The label of the fertilizer will list numbers, for
   example 5-10-5, which refer to the percent by weight of the primary macronutrients.

    Soils play a role

   Soil is weathered, decomposed rock and mineral (geological) fragments mixed with air and water.
   Fertile soil contains the nutrients in a readily available form that plants require for growth.
   The roots of the plant act as miners moving through the soil and bringing needed minerals into
   the plant roots.

   Plants use these minerals in:
    1. Structural components in carbohydrates and proteins
    2. Organic molecules used in metabolism, such as the Magnesium in chlorophyll and the
       Phosphorous found in ATP
    3. Enzyme activators like potassium, which activates possibly fifty enzymes
    4. Maintaining osmotic balance
    Mycorrhizae, bacteria, and minerals

   Plants need nitrogen for many important biological molecules including nucleotides and proteins.
   However, the nitrogen in the atmosphere is not in a form that plants can utilize. Many plants
   have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria growing in their roots: organic nitrogen as rent for
   space to live. These plants tend to have root nodules in which the nitrogen-fixing bacteria
   live.

   All the nitrogen in living systems was at one time processed by these bacteria, who took
   atmospheric nitrogen (N[2]) and modified it to a form that living things could utilize (such as
   NO[3] or NO[4]; or even as ammonia, NH[3] in the example shown below).

   Not all bacteria utilize the above route of nitrogen fixation. Many that live free in the soil,
   utilize other chemical pathways.

   Roots have extensions of the root epidemal cells known as root hairs. While root hairs greatly
   enhance the surface area (hence absorbtion surface), the addition of symbiotic mycorrhizae fungi
   vastly increases the area of the root for absorbing water and minerals from the soil.

  Water and Mineral Uptake | Back to Top

   Animals have a circulatory system that transports fluids, chemicals, and nutrients around within
   the animal body. Some plants have an analogous system: the vascular system in vascular plants;
   trumpet hyphae in bryophytes.

   Root hairs are thin-walled extensions of the epidermal cells in roots. They provide increased
   surface area and thus more efficient absorption of water and minerals. Water and dissolved
   mineral nutrients enter the plant via two routes.

   Water and selected solutes pass through only the cell membrane of the epidermis of the root hair
   and then through plasmodesmata on every cell until they reach the xylem: intracellular route
   (apoplastic). Water and solutes enter the cell wall of the root hair and pass between the wall
   and plasma membrane until the encounter the endodermis, a layer of cells that they must pass
   through to enter the xylem: extracellular route (symplastic).

                                           [waterflow.gif]

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   The endodermis has a strip of water-proof material (containing suberin) known as the Casparian
   strip that forces water through the endodermal cell and in such a way regulates the amount of
   water getting to the xylem. Only when water concentrations inside the endodermal cell fall below
   that of the cortex parenchyma cells does water flow into the endodermis and on into the xylem.

                                           [casparian.gif]

  Xylem and Transport | Back to Top

   Xylem is the water transporting tissue in plants that is dead when it reaches functional
   maturity. Tracheids are long, tapered cells of xylem that have end plates on the cells that
   contain a great many crossbars. Tracheid walls are festooned with pits. Vessels, an improved
   form of tracheid, have no (or very few) obstructions (crossbars) on the top or bottom of the
   cell. The functional diameter of vessels is greater than that of tracheids.

   Water is pulled up the xylem by the force of transpiration, water loss from leaves. Mature corn
   plants can each transpire four gallons of water per week. Transpiration rates in arid-region
   plants can be even higher. Water molecules are hydrogen bonded to each other. Water lost from
   the leaves causes diffusion of additional water molecules out of the leaf vein xylem, creating a
   tug on water molecules along the water columns within the xylem. This "tug" causes water
   molecules to rise up from the roots to eventually the leaves. The loss of water from the root
   xylem allows additional water to pass throught the endodermis into the root xylem.

   Cohesion is the ability of molecules of the same kind to stick together. Water molecules are
   polar, having slight positive and negative sides, which causes their cohesion. Inside the xylem,
   water molecules are in a long chain extending from the roots to the leaves.

   Adhesion is the tendency of molecules of different kinds to stick together. Water sticks to the
   cellulose molecules in the walls of the xylem, counteracting the force of gravity and aiding the
   rise of water within the xylem.

    Cohesion-Adhesion Theory

   Transpiration exerts a pull on the water column within the xylem. The lost water molecules are
   replaced by water from the xylem of the leaf veins, causing a tug on water in the xylem.
   Adhesion of water to the cell walls of the xylem facilitates movement of water upward within the
   xylem. This combination of cohesive and adhesive forces is referred to as the Cohesion-Adhesion
   Theory.

  Guard Cells Regulate Transpiration | Back to Top

   In most environments, the water concentration outside the leaf is less than that inside the
   leaf, causing a loss of water through openings in the leaf known as stomata (singular = stoma).
   Guard cells are crescent-shaped cells of the epidermis that flank the stoma and regulate the
   size of the opening. Together, the guard cells and stoma comprise the stomatal apparatus. The
   inner wall of the guard cell is thicker than the rest of the wall. When a guard cell takes up
   potassium ions, water moves into the cell, causing the cell to become turgid and swell, opening
   the stoma. When the potassium leaves the guard cell, the water also leaves, causing plasmolysis
   of the cells, and a closing of the stoma. Stomata occupy 1% of the leaf surface, but account for
   90% of the water lost in transpiration.

  Transportation and Storage of Nutrients | Back to Top

   Plants make sugar by photosynthesis, usually in their leaves. Some of this sugar is directly
   used for the metabolism of the plant, some for the synthesis of proteins and lipids, some stored
   as starch. Other parts of the plant also need energy but are not photosynthetic, such as the
   roots. Food must therefore be transported in from a source, an action accomplished by the phloem
   tissue.

    Phloem, Sugar, and Translocation

   Phloem consists of several types of cells: sieve tube cells (aka sieve elements), companion
   cells, and the vascular parenchyma. Sieve cells are tubular cells with endwalls known as sieve
   plates. Most lose their nuclei but remain alive, leaving an empty cell with a functioning plasma
   membrane.

   Companion cells load sugar into the sieve element (sieve elements are connected into sieve
   tubes). Fluids can move up or down within the phloem, and are translocated from one place to
   another. Sources are places where sugars are being produced. Sinks are places where sugar is
   being consumed or stored.

   Food moves through the phloem by a Pressure-Flow Mechanism. Sugar moves (by an energy-requiring
   step) from a source (usually leaves) to a sink (usually roots) by osmotic pressure.
   Translocation of sugar into a sieve element causes water to enter that cell, increasing the
   pressure of the sugar/water mix (phloem sap). The pressure causes the sap to flow toward an area
   of lower pressure, the sink. In the sink, the sugar is removed from the phloem by another
   energy-requiring step and usually converted into starch or metabolized.

  Plants Respond to External Stimuli | Back to Top

   One plant response to environmental stimulus involves plant parts moving toward or away from the
   stimulus, a movement known as a tropism. Nastic movements are plant movements independent of the
   direction of the stimulus.

    Alterations in Growth Patterns Generate Tropisms

   Charles Darwin and his son Francis studied the familiar reaction of plants growing toward light:
   phototropism. The Darwins discovered that the tips of the plant curved first, and that the curve
   extended gradually down the stem. By covering the tips with foil, they prevented the plant from
   curving. They concluded that some factor was transmitted from the tip of the plant to the lower
   regions, causing the plant to bend.

                                          [phototrop_1.gif]

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   We now know, from the 1926 experiments of Frits Went, that auxin, a plant hormone produced in
   the stem tip (auxins promote cell elongation), moves to the darker side of the plant, causing
   the cells there to grow larger than corresponding cells on the lighter side of the plant. This
   produces a curving of the plant stem tip toward the light, a plant movement known as
   phototropism.

   Geotropism is plant response to gravity. Roots of plants show positive geotropism, shoots show
   negative geotropism. Geotropism was once thought a result of gravity influencing auxin
   concentration. Several new hypotheses are currently under investigation.

   Thigmotropism is plant response to contact with a solid object. Tendrils of vines warp around
   objects, allowing the vine to grow upward.

   ism_Passion_flower.

   Nastic movements, such as nyctinasty, result from several types of stimuli, including light and
   touch. Legumes turn their leaves in response to day/night conditions. Mimosa , also known as the
   sensitive plant, has its leaves close up when touched.

   Photoperiodism is the plant response to the relative amounts of light and dark in a 24 hour
   period, and controls the flowering of many plants. Short-day plants flower during early spring
   or fall, when the nights are relatively longer and the days are relatively shorter. Long-day
   plants flower mostly in summer, when the nights are relatively shorter and the days are
   relatively longer. Day-neutral plants flower without respect for the day length. Phytochrome is
   a plant pigment in the leaves of plants that detects the day length and generates a response.

  Plant Secondary Compounds | Back to Top

   Plants produce primary compounds important in their metabolism. They also produce secondary
   compounds that serve to attract pollinators, kill parasites, and prevent infectious diseases.
   Pea plants produce pisatin, a chemical that protects them from most strains of parasitic fungi.
   Some strains of the fungus (Fusarium) contain enzymes that inactivate pisatin, allowing them to
   infect pea plants.

   Some plants produce natural insecticides, such as pyrethrum, a chemical produced by
   chrysanthemums that is also commercially available to gardeners. Antinutrients are chemical
   produced when plants are under attack. These compounds inhibit the action of enzymes in the
   insect's digestive system.

   More that 10,000 defensive chemicals have been identified, including caffeine, phenol, tannin,
   nicotine, and morphine.

   Some plant secondary compounds are useful to humans as
    1. pesticides
    2. medicines (salicylic acid, the main component in aspirin)
    3. stimulants (caffeine, the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world)
    4. chewing gum (chicle, a compound from the sapodilla tree in Mexico was used in the first
       chewing gum).
