   The Mesozoic era covers the time between two great extinctions: the Permian extinction that
   closed the Paleozoic era, and the Cretaceous extinction that ended the reign of the dinosaurs
   (as well as the Mesozoic). The Mesozoic era is divided into three geologic periods, the Triassic
   ( 245-208 million years ago), the Jurassic (208-146 million years ago), and the Cretaceous
   (146-65 million years ago).

   The Mesozoic was the time of the beginning of the breakup of Pangaea about 225-200 million years
   ago, eventually fragmenting that supercontinent into the modern continents. This breakup had
   profound consequences for living things, as had the earlier formation of Pangaea during the
   later Paleozoic. The breakup continues today!

   Mesozoic seas saw a rise and spread of another iteration of the cephalopods, the ceratites,
   eventually to be replaced by the ammonites. Coral reefs, which had been decimated by the
   Carboniferous extinction returned to prominence with the evolution of new groups of
   reef-building animals and algae. Modern bony fish evolved and began to compete with the
   ammonites as swimming predators.

   Terrestrial animals saw the rise of major groups of tetrapods: dinosaurs and mammals and the
   later advent of birds. Tetrapods took to new envirponments in the air as well as a secondary
   return to the waters. Forests took on an increasingly modern look, with the evolution of cycads
   and cycadeoids, conifers and ginkgoes. Flowering plants finally appeared about 140 million years
   ago and have risen to become the dominant floral component of many areas of the planet.

   The Mesozoic ended with the great mass extinction that eliminated nearly 75% of all species,
   including dinosaurs, swimming and flying reptiles, and ammonites. The causes of this extinction
   have long been speculated on and are not presently conclusively settled.

  The Triassic | Back to Top

   The Triassic period lasted from 245 to 208 million years ago. Following the massive extinction
   at the end of the Permian, the survivors underwent adaptive radiations as they diversified and
   began to reoccupy many of the now-vacated environmental roles.

                                            [atri01b.gif]

    Life in Water

   Coral, decimated by Paleozoic extinctions, rebounded during the Triassic with the evolution of
   the scleractinian corals. Dinoflagellates made their first appearance as part of the
   phytoplankton. Dinoflagellates have an excellent fossil record and make useful index fossils for
   age dating of rocks. The oldest possible dinoflagellate was Arpylorus antiquus, from the
   Silurian period. Dinoflagellates become more common in Triassic and younger rocks. Modern
   scleractinian corals have some symbiotic dinoflagellates, known as zooxanthellae, living inside
   the coral. Both groups seem to appear in the fossil record at approximately the same time,
   suggesting the symbiosis was a valuable relationship.

   Another group of phytoplankton that appeard at the end of the Triassic was the
   coccolithophorids, usually shortened to coccoliths. These small fragments of a much larger, yet
   still microscopic, creature collect calcium carbonate from the seawater and use it to build
   their small "skeletons". Below is an electron micrograph of a coccolith collection formed by a
   modern alga.

   The cephalopods recovered from the extinction of the goniatites and developed a remarkably
   similar group, the ceratites. These coiled, chambered animals had slightly more complex sutures
   than did the goniatites.

   Bivalves (specifically pelecypods) became more abundant and important parts of reefs as the
   Triassic progressed, and would remain important parts of the marine fauna throughout the
   Mesozoic.

    Life on Land

      Plants

   Unlike marine animals, terrestrial plants for the most part (save the cordaites) escaped the
   great Permian extinction. The Triassic was a period of transition for the world's floras, as
   Paleozoic plants such as the calamites and lycopsids declined in favor of newer gymnosperm
   groups such as the "cycads". During the Triassic up to 20% of the world's flora consisted of
   cycads, the acme of the group that today has declined to but a few genera restricted to the
   tropics.

   Plants possibly allied to the modern ginkgoes have been found in Permian aged sediments. These
   plants have been classified in the leaf-genera Ginkgoites and Baiera, although recent studies
   suggest these genera are really morphological variants and that the modern genus Ginkgo should
   be used to include these fossils. During the Mesozoic ginkgoes were worldwide in their
   distribution and important elements in the gymnosperm forests that dominated the land.

   The glossopterids persisted in Gondwana but were gradually replaced by a new flora characterized
   by the seed fern, Dicroidium. By the close of the Triassic the glossopterids were extinct.

      Animals

   Terrestrial faunas of the early Triassic were dominated by therapsids, evolutionary offshoots of
   the by-then extinct "sail-backs". These therapsids divided into two groups: herbivores and
   carnivores. The therapsids of this time may have had some sort of "hair" as a body covering as
   well as some degree of endothermy. By the close of the Triassic therapsids had given rise to
   early mammals.

   The ancestors of modern turtles appeared during the Triassic. Whereas modern turtles have lost
   their teeth, these Triassic turtles retained teeth on their jaws.

   Another reptile group, the euryapsids, made the transition from land to sea during the Triassic.
   These swimming reptiles diverged into three groups during the Triassic: the ichthyosaurs
   (dolphin-shaped swimming reptiles), the placodonts (bulky, paddle-limbed reptiles that went
   extinct by the end of the Triassic), and the nothosaurs (streamlined, long-necked swimming
   predators).

   The diapsids, the "reptiles" except for turtles and a few extinct forms, rose to prominence
   during the latter Triassic times. Diapsids, you recall, have two openings in the skull behind
   the eye socket. While the diapsids had originated possibly as far back as the late
   Carboniferous, they did not become major elements of the fauna until the Triassic. The major
   group of diapsids, the archosaurs (ruling reptiles) evolved in the later part of the Permian,
   and underwent a major adaptive radiation in the late Triassic. Today only the birds and
   crocodiles remain of the once dominant ruling reptile group.

   The first true crocodiles also appeared during the Triassic. Several other reptile groups, such
   as the Triassic phytosaurs, adapted to the environment that crocodiles lived in. Due to
   evolutionary convergence, these animals took on an outer semblance of crocodiles, even though
   there were numerous anatomical differences. The ancestral crocodiles fully occupied the
   phytosaur niche in the environment after the extinction of phytosaurs at the close of the
   Triassic.

   One early archosaur was Euparkeria, a small, Triassic-aged, quadrupedal reptile that some
   scientists think may have been able to run short distances on its hind legs. Euparkeria
   specimens reach about 0.5 meters in length. The genus appears restricted to the Triassic of
   South Africa.

   Another archosaur, at one time considered a dinosaur, was Herrerasaurus, from the Triassic of
   Argentina. This animal marked the transition between the archosaur stem group and the derived
   dinosaurs. In all but a few characteristics Herrerasaurus is a dinosaur, although a smallish one
   of 3-4 meters in length and a body weight estimated at around 300 kg.. Eoraptor, from the same
   age and area, was another archosaur with a mosaic of dinosaurian and nondinosaurian
   characteristics.

   The Triassic saw the evolution of the first true dinosaurs, the ceratosaurians, or horned
   dinosaurs. These bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs have skeletons with a number of bird-like
   features. Famous members of this group include Dilophosaurus and Coelophysis. Both occur in
   Triassic deposits in the North American Painted Desert. Coelophysis and similar dinosaurs are
   known from other Triassic rocks throughout Pangaea. Unlike the specimen shown in the movie
   Jurassic Park, Dilophosaurus did not have a wide fringe nor is ther any evidence that it spit
   venom. But then, you know how movies are, right? Dilophosaurus was a slender 6-7 meters long
   dinosaur that weighed an estimated 300-400 kg. Coelophysis was less than 3 meters long and
   weighed a slight 15-30 kg.

   The dinosaurs have traditionally been classified into two distinct taxonomic classes, the
   saurischia (lizard-hipped) and ornithischia (bird-hipped). This divergence was accomplished by
   the close of the Triassic. The ancestors of dinosaurs were some unspecified thecodont earlier in
   the Triassic. The Saurischia, which includes Dilophosaurus and Coelophysis, has two main groups,
   the theropods and the sauropods. The theropods were bipedal carnivores that included the famous
   Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus rex as well as birds. Sauropods and similar forms were
   quadrupedal, mostly herbovorous forms that include the giants of the Jurassic: Apatosaurus,
   Diplodicus, and Brachiosaurus. The recently discovered Arizona dinosaur Sonorasaurus belongs in
   this group as well. Ornithischians were all herbivourous, with some retaining a bipedal gait,
   and others returning to four legs, and included: the ornithopods (such as Trachodon and
   Maiasaurus), ceratopsians (such as Triceratops), and the stegosaurians (including Stegosaurus
   and Ankylosaurus).

   Mammals also evolved during the Triassic, at about the same time as the dinosaurs. However,
   Triassic mammals were small and inconsequential components of the Triassic ecosystems.

    The Triassic World

   Pangaea reached its greatest extent during the Triassic. The conditions from the Permian (dry
   continental interiors, few if any shallow marginal continental seas) continued. Around the
   middle of the Triassic the breakup of Pangaea began, with the supercontinent separating into two
   landmasses, Gondwana in the south (composed of the future continents of South America, Africa,
   India, Antarctica, and Australia) and Laurasia in the north (Asia and North America). The
   breakup of Pangaea also resulted in mountain-building along the western edges of North and South
   America.

    The Triassic Extinction

   At the end of the Triassic a minor mass extinction occurred. The cause of this is still in
   dispute, although the consensus opinion involves global cooling associated with an asteroid
   impact or comet showers. The victims of this event included the labyrinthodont amphibians,
   conodonts, and all marine reptiles except ichthyosaurs. Thecodonts, brachiopods, gastropods, and
   molluscs also suffered a loss of diversity as did the synapsids. As with larger mass
   extinctions, the Triassic die off opened ecological spaces into which the dinosaurs and other
   creatures moved during the Jurassic.

  The Jurassic | Back to Top

   The Jurassic period spanned the time interval from 208 to 146 million years ago. The major
   events of the Jurassic were the explosive adaptive radiation of dinosaurs and the evolution of
   birds (sometimes referred to as the avian dinosaurs), the diversification of the cycads, seed
   ferns and the "cycadeoids", and the continued breakup of Pangaea. The opening of the Atlantic
   Ocean between Africa and North America created new shallow-water environments, as did the global
   rise of sea-levels that occurred during the Jurassic. As you might expect, marine life responded
   with a burst of adaptation and the appearance of new forms.

    Life in Water

   The separation of Pangaea caused the formation of new oceans, such as the Atlantic. It also led
   to a global rise in sea-level. Consequently there were many more environmental spaces open for
   exploitation. Since the Trissic extinction was not nearly as calamitous as the Permian one, life
   rebounded much quicker.

   Dinoflagellates and coccoliths became major elements of the oceanic phytoplankton. The bivalves,
   specifically the rudistids, began to play a larger role in reef formation.

                                            [140_346.jpg]

   The cephalopods again produced a new coiled, chambered form, the ammonites. Suture patterns of
   these forms were even more elaborate than those found in the Triassic ceratites. The belemnites
   were straight-shelled cephalopods with elaborate suture patterns.

   The ichthyosaurs had been virtually unaffected by the Triassic extinction. During the Jurassic
   they reached their peak of diversity and prevalence ecologically. Whereas the triassic forms had
   resembled swimming lizards, Jurassic and later forms took on increasngly fish-like shapes.

   Stenopterygius quadriscissus was a Jurassic ichthyosaur (a reptile) which reached lenghts of
   10-12 feet. Large eyes provided for keen sight. Unlike otherswimming reptiles which could come
   out on land to lay eggs, the ichthyosaurs gave birth to live young, eliminating the need to
   leave the water. Image and caption from http://seaborg.nmu.edu/earth/jurassic/jur02b.html.

   In addition to ichthyosaurs, Jurassic seas also contained long-necked plesiosaurs. Plesiosaurs
   evolved at the end of the Triassic, most likely from nothosaurs, and diversified during the
   Jurassic, persisting until the terminal Cretaceous event that closed the Mesozoic era. While
   most of us think of plesiosaurs as having long necks, there are also short-necked forms. Unlike
   the ichthyosaurs, which swam in a fishlike manner, plesiosaurs swam by using their paddle-like
   limbs in a manner similar to that of a sea lion or seal. Plesiosaurs did not give birth to live
   young, but instead crawled ashore to lay eggs as turtles do.

    Life on Land

   The Jurassic terrestrial environments saw an increase in gymnosperm groups such as the cycads,
   ginkgoes, and cycadeoids. Reptilian groups also became more adept at flying, while the dinosaurs
   grew in size with such giants as Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus, and ferocious predators like
   Allosaurus. The first birds appeared, as did the most famous fossil bird, Archaeopteryx.

      Plants

   The Jurassic was a time of increasing diversity for the cycads and a similar-looking group, the
   cycadeoids. The cycadeoids, sometimes known as the Bennettitales, produced leaves that
   superficially resembled cycad leaves. However, details of the reproductive structures indicate
   the two were not closely related. During the Mesozic leaves of these groups were so common that
   paleobotanists refer to the era as the age of cycads.

        Cycads

   The modern cycads are a pale remnant of the dominant plants of the Mesozoic, with today only 160
   species in 11 genera, confined to the tropics. Cycads retain some fern-like features, notably
   pinnate leaves and circinate vernation. However, they (usually) produce cones of
   nonphotosynthetic reproductive structures. These cones are unisexual, in fact the plants are
   dioecious, having separate male and female plants. Based on structure of the leaf cuticle,
   cycads are usually separated from the cycadeoids. A number of leaf genera from the Mesozoic have
   been assigned to the cycads: Taeniopteris and Nilssonia.

        Cycadeoids

   The cycadeoids superficially resemble cycads in having recurrent leaf bases on soft-wood stems.
   Unlike the cycads, however, the cycadeoids have bisexual reproductive structures and structure
   of their stomates more like what is found in angiosperms and gnetophytes. Their reproductive
   structures were at one time interpreted as flowers and the cycadeoids were suggested as
   ancestors to the flowering plants. Cladistic analyses, such as Doyle and Donoghue (1986),
   suggest the cycadeoids and the flowering plants belong to the same clade, the anthophyte clade,
   but that cycadeoids are not the sister group for the angiosperms.

        Ginkgophytes

   The ginkgoes, like the cycads, originated during the late Paleozoic and diversified during the
   Mesozoic. Beginning during the Jurassic the number of species increased to a maximum of 11
   during the Cretaceous before the decline to the single species, Ginkgo biloba, that remains
   today.

        Othe Gymnosperms

   The Mesozoic saw the spread of true conifers, including forms similar to Metasequioia and
   Sequoia, as well as numerous types of pines. A wide variety of extinct gymnosperms were present,
   including Caytonia and Pentoxylon.

      Animals

        Flying Reptiles

   The flying reptiles of the Triassic underwent diversification during the Jurassic. The
   pterosaurs (literally winged-lizard) consisted of the earlier forms with long tails, like
   Rhamphorhynchus shown below, and the later forms that ruled the Cretaceous period, the
   pterodactyls. The long tailed formns died out by the close of the Jurassic. Pterosaurs had
   hollow bones, large brains and possibly some had endothermy.

        Dinosaurs

   In contrast to the Triassic dinosaurs, the Jurassic forms became even larger and more fierce.
   While most Triassic dinosaurs were saurischians, the ornithischians became more prominent during
   the Jurassic.

   The small, bipedal saurischians of the Triassic continued in the Jurassic, as exemplified by
   Ornithomimus. This dinosaur had no teeth in its jaws, a bird-like head, and a long, ostrich-like
   neck, was around 3 meters long and weighed approximately 100-150 kg.

   The true giants of the finosaur world were the sauropods. These quadrupedal, herbivores included
   Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, and Diplodocus. Paleontologists believe that the sauropod clade
   evolved from a Triassic ancestor similar to Plateosaurus. Sauropods ate numerous types of
   plants, often specializing in plants of a certain height. Since the teeth of sauropods are not
   adapted for grinding, this mechanical part of the digestive process was accomplished in their
   stomachs. Sauropod skeletons are often found in association with curiosuly rounded stones in the
   approximate position of the stomach. These "stomach stones" are known as gastroliths, and served
   a similar function in sauropods as bird gravel does in birds: to aid digestion of plant material
   not ground up enough in the mouth. Gastroliths are not unique to sauropods, as many other
   herbivorous dinosaurs and plesiosaurs have been found with stomach stones.

   Apatosaurus, once much better known as "Brontosaurus", was a herbivore from the Jurassic
   deposits in the western United States that ranged from 21 to 26 meters long, and had an
   estimated weight of between 30 and 35 tons. For over 100 years after its discovery, Apatosaurus
   skeleton was fitted with the wrong head. During the 1980s the error was discovered and the
   correct head (which had been descxribed separately from the skeleton) wwas attached. Owing to
   the rules of zoological nomenclature, the recponstructed fossil would take the name of the
   oldest described part, in this case the head. Thus paleontology lost a truly great scientific
   name, Brontosaurus, which literally means "thunder lizard". The name "Brontosaurus" is invalid
   and the correct name is Apatosaurus.

   Naming was not the only error. Apatosaurus weighed over 30 tons when alive, and early
   paleontologists considered the animal too heavy to have lived on land. The frequently drew
   Apatosaurus living in water where the water would help support the animal's weight. In modern
   reconstructions of the the Apatosaurus environment the vegetation is not swampy but almost
   desert-like, and Apatosaurus is now considered to have been a fully terrestrial animal.

   Barchiosaurus (22 to 30 meters long; 30 to 80 tons weight) was a larger dinosaur than
   Apatosaurus, and for many years was considered the heaviest of the sauropods. Brachiosaurs, as
   shown below, were different from other sauropods in having their forelegs longer than their hind
   legs, as well as having their nostrils high on the forehead. The largest known doinosaur,
   Ultrasaurus, either belongs to the brachiosaurs or is in fact a large specimen of Brachiosaurus,
   according to some paleontologists.

   The remaining saurishian dinosaurs were theropods, the bipedal carnivores exemplified by
   Allosaurus. Deciphering the evolutionary relationships of the theropods is difficult due to the
   often fragmentary nature of theropod fossils. Current thought is that there were several groups
   of theropods, and that one group, the carnosaurids contained the largest of the carnivores such
   as Allosaurus. Another theropod group was the coelurosaurids, which containd the birds and
   smaller carnivores such as ornithomimids, "raptors", and the tyrannosaurs.

   The carnosaurs, such as the Jurassic-aged Allosaurus, had long narrow skulls, strong forelimbs,
   and a variety of horns or knobs projecting from the skull.

   One of the hottest topics of discussion for years was the hypothesis, proposed by Charles
   Darwin, that birds were descendants of dinosaurs. The shared derived characteristics of birds
   and dinosaurs include the structure of the hip, egg-laying, as well as a great deal of
   anatomical similarity. The 1861 discovery of Archaeopteryx, the "first bird" added fuel to this
   discussion. Archaeopteryx has a skeleton that retains a number of dinosaurian traits such as
   scales on the neck, teeth in the mouth, a jointed tail, and grasping fingers on the wings. It
   also has avian characteristics such as hollow bones and flight feathers. Many "dinosaur"
   specimens have, upon the discovery of feathers, been reassigned to fossil bird species. The
   discovery of feathers on some dinosaurs has further blurred what was once a clear-cut
   distinction between birds and dinosaurs. Cladistic analyses have repeatedly shown that birds and
   some groups of dinosaurs form a well-defined clade. Most paleontologists today feel safe in
   stating that birds are dinosaurs.

   There have been other fossils interpreted as birds, specifically Protoavis from the Triassic of
   Texas and Confuscornis from the Jurassic of China. While some paleontologists accept Protoavis
   as representing a bird that is closer to modern birds than is Archaeopteryx, there is an equally
   large camp who consider Protoavis as an early dinosaur that had evolved several bird-like
   adaptations by convergent evolution.

                                            [161_632.gif]

   Confuciusornis sanctus, the oldest bird with a beak, from Liaoning Province, China. This species
   retained some of the primitive features seen in Archaeoptyeryx, such as free claws on the wing,
   along with more advanced features such as the lack of teeth in the bill. Image from
   http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galleri/montre/english/161_632.htm.

   The consensus view is that the coelurosaurs are the dinosaurian group from which the "avian
   dinosaurs" evolved. Members of this group include the small predatory dinosaurs such as
   Compsognathus (again a star of the Jurassic Park movies), and Velociraptor.

   The ornithischian dinosaurs became more significant elements of the dinosaurian faunas during
   the Jurassic, and especially so during the Cretaceous period. The ornoithischians are the
   so-called bird-hipped dinosaurs. However, the resemblance of hip structure between birds and
   this group is no longer considered evidence for the rise of birds from ornithischians, but as a
   result of convergent evolution.

   A major group of ornithischians during the Jurassic was the stegosaourids, exemplified by the
   genus Stegosaurus, the state dinosaur of Colorado. These quadrupedal animals sported spiked
   tails and large flat armor plates arrayed along the spine. These plates functioned for
   regulation of body heat. Stegosaurus was about 9 meters long and weighed about 2 tons. Even
   among dinosaurs it is noteworthy for its incredibly small brain.

   background. Image from http://www.elykish.com/Gallery/Dinosaurs/overview.htm, used with

   The ankylosaurs were the armored ornithischians. They appeared in Europe during the late
   Jurassic and became more abundant during the Cretaceous. Ankylosaurs bore armor and spikes on
   their backs and may have defended themselves by using their tails (which often had armor balls
   at the tips) and by their dense back armor.

   Another group of ornithischians was the ornithopods. Among the earliest ornithopods was
   Camptosaurus, a 17 foot long Jurassic dinosaur from Europe and North America. Camptosaurus
   reached Australia by the early Cretaceous. During the Cretaceous the ornithopods became much
   more diverse.

    The Jurassic World

   The major geological events of the Jurassic involved the continued separation of the former
   parts of Pangaea. During this period the northern Atlantic continued to open, with a small
   connection remaining between North America and Europe. In the southern hemisphere the former
   parts of Gondwana completely separated, with Antarctica and Australia being the last of the
   modern southern continents to form. Great seaways flooded most of the continents, possibly
   caused by the increased rates of sea-floor formation at the newly forming mid-Atlantic ridge.
   Active tectonic plate margins along the then-western coasts of the Americas began or continued
   the mountain-building that would become the Rocky Mountains in North America and the Andes
   Mountains in South America.

    The Jurassic Extinctions

   The Jurassic saw two minor mass extinctions. The first of these occurred about one-third of the
   way through the period, during the early Jurassic. This first Jurassic extinction affected
   approximately 80% of the bivalves as well as other shallow water organisms. At the close of the
   Jurassic, about 140 million years ago, a second minor mass extinction happened, affecting mostly
   the ammonoids, marine reptiles, bivalves and certain dinosaur groups such as the stegosaurs and
   the giant sauropods. Only one stegosaur escaped this extinction, Dravidosaurus, a small
   stegosaurid restricted to the Cretaceous of India (which was an island at that time). The causes
   of both of these extinctions are not clear.

  The Cretaceous | Back to Top

   The Cretaceous period, spanning the time interval from 144 to 65 million years ago, saw the
   final phases of the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the northward migration of India
   toward its collision with Asia during the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era. The last of the
   major forms of plant life, the angiosperms, appeared near the beginning of the period. Dinosaurs
   continued their diversification, with the increasing dominance of the herbivorous
   ornithischians. The Cretaceous ended with the famous mass extinction that resulted in the
   extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, the swimming reptiles, pterosaurs, ammonites and other
   creatures, nearly three-fourths of all life on Earth in fact.

    Life in Water

   The bivalves recovered from the Jurassic extinctions and again became major reef-formers in the
   numerous shallow marginal seas that encroached onto the continents during the Cretaceous.

   Ammonites continued their dominance, as did their relatives the straight-shelled belemnites.
   Modern teleost fish appeared during the Cretaceous and may have competed for the same prey as
   the ammonites. The teleost fish were apparently stronger and swifter swimmers than the fish of
   the Jurassic. Some paleontologists speculate that the extinction of ichthyosaurs during the
   Cretaceous may have been hastened by the rise of these new faster fish that would have been
   difficult for the ichthyosaurs to catch and eat.

   Baculites, a genus of straight-shelled cephalopods, was particularly abundant in the Cretaceous
   seas. Note the elaborate suture patterns in the fossil specimen below.

   extremely intricate suturing between septa. (image from
   http://seaborg.nmu.edu/earth/cret/cre08b.html ).

   The plesiosaurs from the Jurassic continued their diversification. Ichthyosaurs, however,
   declined during the early Cretaceous before becoming extinct well before the
   end-of-the-Cretaceous extinction. Both the long-necked plesiosaurs, and the short-necked
   pliosaurs were present during the Cretaceous. Despite inevitable competition and changes in
   their diets as new prey evolved, plesiosaurs were doing well up until the extinction at the
   close of the Cretaceous.

   To the list of swimming reptiles we add the mosasaurs, essentially swimming "lizards". These
   ferocious predators reached lengths to 30 feet (9 meters). Mosasaurs are usually considered
   relatives of the monitor lizards, although some recent analyses suggest a closer link to snakes
   is a distinct possibility. Mosasaurs were predators of the Cretaceous seas. Many ammonite
   fossils have been found that have tooth marks suggesting mosasaurs actively sought and ate
   ammonites. Some paleontologoists believe that mosasaurs became so successful because they were
   able to utilize the role in the marine environment that was opened once the ichthyosaurs went
   extinct. Mosasaurs apparently gave birth to live young and perhaps had some level of parental
   care for their young.

    Life on Land

   Perhaps the greatest change in the terrestrial life of the Cretaceous was the rise and
   diversification of the flowering plants, the angiosperms. The angiosperms, the last of the seed
   plant groups to evolve, appeared over 140 million years ago during the the beginning of the
   Cretaceous. All members of this group produce flowers. Within the female parts of the flower
   angiosperms produce a diploid zygote and triploid endosperm. Fertilization is accomplished by a
   variety of pollinators, including wind, animals, and water. Two sperm are released into the
   female gametophyte: one fuses with the egg to produce the zygote, the other helps form the
   nutritive tissue known as endosperm. The angiosperms (angios = hidden) produce modified leaves
   grouped into flowers that in turn develop fruits and seeds. There are presently 235,000 known
   living species.

   Whence came the angiosperms? This was Darwin's "abominable mystery". Clearly angiosperms are
   descended from some group of Mesozoic-aged gymnosperm seed plant....but which one? Click here to
   view an online lab exercise in phylogeny and try to figure things out!

   The flowering plants most likely evolved from a Mesozoic gymnosperm group. At one time the
   cycadeoids were the prime candidates, although more recent studies suggest another group, the
   gnetophytes as the sister group to the angiosperms. Three distinctive genera comprise this
   group: Welwitschia, Gnetum, and Ephedra. Ephedra occurs in the western United States where it
   has the common name "Mormon tea". It is a natural source for the chemical ephedrine, although
   there is no evidence the Mormons in Utah (where the plant is extremely common) ever used it for
   tea, the use of stimulants being against their beliefs. Welwitschia is limited to coastal
   deserts in South Africa, although fossil leaf, cuticle and pollen evidence indicates plants of
   this type were widespread during the Mesozoic era. Welwitschia is noted for its two long,
   prominent leaves. Gnetum has leaves that look remarkably like those in angiosperms, as well as
   vessels in the xylem, generally considered an angiosperm characteristic. Gnetophytes appear in
   the fossil record before the angiosperms do, and share a great many derived characteristics,
   making them the current choice as the angiosperm sister group (or ancestral group in a
   noncladistic sense).

   The classical view of flowering plant evolution suggests early angiosperms were evergreen trees
   that produced large Magnolia-like flowers. Click here to view an illustration of suggested paths
   of floral evolution. However, this view has recently been contradicted by the oldest fossil yet
   found, a 140 million year old plant found by paleobotanist David Dilcher and his associates at
   the Florida Museum of Natural History.

   The angiosperms underwent an adaptive radiation during the Cretaceous, and for the most part
   escaped the major extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous. One group of angiosperms that did
   suffer from the extinction was the unknown groups of plants that produced triprojectate pollen.
   My dissertation dealt with the systematics of this fossil group. The pollen is quite odd-shaped
   and quite striking to see.

   Crocodiles, which had been around since the Triassic, produced a massive form, Deinosuchus,
   during the Cretaceous. This marine crocodile was over 20 feet long, and dwarfs the largest
   modern crocodile.

   The ornithischian dinosaurs during the Cretaceous evolved into a number of interesting groups.
   From bipedal ornithischians during the Jurassic, like Camptosaurus, the larger and more nimble
   ornithopods of the Cretaceous evolved. One of the first dinosaurs to be scientifically described
   was Iguanodon, a bipedal herbivore thought to have moved about in herds. Iguanodon was between 6
   and 10 meters long and weighed around 5 tons.

   The hadrosaurs, commonly known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, are another group of ornithopods.
   These animals had hundreds of teeth in a bill reminiscent of a duck's bill (although ducks lack
   teeth). There were two subgroups of hadrosaurs. The crested lambeosaurs, and the noncrested
   hadrosaurines. The latter group is exemplified by Maiasaura and Edmontosaurus. The lambeosaurs
   are exemplified by Parasaurolophus. Maiasaura, the "good mother lizard" has been extensively
   studied for its nesting and parental care.

   Ely Kish.

   Another major group of Cretaceous ornithischians was the ankylosaurs, the armored, quadrupedal
   herbivores. Unlike the Jurassic stegosaurids, the armor covering on the back was more robust, as
   were the spikes behind the shoulders. In some ankylosaurs the tail terminated in a bony knob
   that might have been used to sweep the legs of predators, possibly even breaking bones.

                                          [1Sauropelta.jpg]

   The other great ornithischian group was the ceratopsians.  These quadrupedal herbivores were
   characterized by a beak-like snout, horns above the eyes and possibly on the end of the nose,
   and some degree of a bony frill around the back of the skull. Triceratops is perhaps the most
   famous and well known of this group. Triceratops was about 8 meters long and weighed between 4
   and 8 tons. Ceratopsians first evolved, possibly from an ornithopod ancestral group, at the
   beginning of the Cretaceous, some 140 million years ago. By the end of that geological period,
   ceratopsians were among the most common dinosaurs in the northern hemispjere. Triceratops in
   fact was one of the last of the nonavian dinosaurs.

   The saurischians of the Cretaceous included the ferocious Tyrannosaurus rex (literally "tyrant
   king lizard "), as well as numerous smaller predatory dinosaurs such as the "raptors"
   popularized by the Jurassic Park series. Spinosaurus, the voracious carnivore of Jurassic Park
   III was an African member of this group. In addition to the carnivores, Cretaceous sauropods
   existed, although diminished in size and abundance from their Jurassic forebearers.

   Perhaps no other dinosaur has inspired as many plush toys, tattoos, and awe as Tyrannosaurus
   rex.  Sporting six inch long serrated teeth T. rex was a meat-eating machine. Tyrannosaurs
   ranged from 10-14 meters in length and weighed in at an estimated 5-7 tons, and were restricted
   to North America during the latest part of the Cretaceous period. The most famous T. rex, and
   possibly the most complete skeleton, was dubbed Sue. This fossil was the object of protracted
   legal fight before being sold to a group of Chicago Field Museum supporters for a reported $7
   million. Sue is now on exhibit at that museum.

   A smaller carnovore that preceeds T. rex in time is Albertosaurus. This smaller version of T.
   rex reached lengths of between 7 and 8.5 meters and weighed in at a mere 2 tons. It ranged North
   America in the time interval just prior to the rise of T. rex.

   A related group of carnivorous Cretaceous dinosaurs is the dromaesaurs, considered by some
   recent studies to be the sister group to the birds. Dromaesaurs had been around since the
   Jurassic or earlier. Sometime during the Jurassic the line leading to birds diverged. The
   dromaesaurs had a variety of unique features, such as their slashing modified foot claw, as well
   as an inferred behavior of grasping with their forelimbs. This latter feature may have been
   important in the evolution of avian dinosaur flight. Until the Cretaceous, dromaesaurs were
   smallish predatory dinosaurs. Deinonychus, considered one of the most important dinosaurs ever
   found, was a small animal about 3-4 meters long, weighing a mere 75 kg. Utahraptor, discovered
   from middle Cretaceous rocks in Utah, is the largest dromaesaurid at a weight of one ton and a
   length of 5 to 7 meters. Velociraptor, the dromaesaurid so prominent in the Jurassic Park
   series, was about 2 meters long and had an estimated weight of 7 to 15 kg.

   The flying reptiles of the Cretaceous were the pterodactyls, short tailed descendants of the
   long tailed Jurassic forms. The largest of the pterodactyls was Quetzalcoatlus, named after the
   Aztec feathered serpent god. Quetzalcoatlus northropii had a wingspan of 11 meters and may have
   weighed over 200 km. Pteranodon (whose scientific name literally means "wing without tooth") was
   a common Cretaceous form that had a 7 meter wingspan as well as a large crest that presumably
   served as a navigational aid.

   Cretaceous birds continued to expand their environmental range. Hesperornis was a flightless
   swimming bird that lived in the shallow seas of the Cretaceous. There were other Cretaceous
   birds that flew. Large, flightless birds, like the ostrich, would not appear until the Tertiary
   period.

   Cretaceous mammals were still quite small and minor components of the fauna. Their significance
   would change with the Cretaceous mass extinction, from which they would emerge as co-rulers of
   the land (with the avian dinosaurs).

    The Cretaceous World

   The breakup of Pangaea continued during the Cretaceous, with the Atlantic Ocean finally opening
   completely by the late Cretaceous. The westward movement of North and South America led to
   massive mountain building episodes that produced parts of the Rocky Mountains in the north and
   the Andes Mountains in the south. During much of the Cretaceous, North America was split into
   two separate land areas by the north-south tending seaway. This led to the development of two
   distinct paleofloristic regions: the Aquilapollenites province in the west and the normapolles
   province in the east. The Aquilapollenites province extended northward through Alaska and
   Siberia and then southward into eastern Asia. The normapolles province passed through Greenland
   and into northern Europe. With the drop in sea-levels at the end of the Cretaceous plants and
   animals were able to migrate between these (and other) regions. India, which had separated from
   the rest of the former Gondwana earlier, remained an island throughout the Cretaceous and into
   the Tertiary period.

   The Cretaceous seems to have been a time period during which the climates were quite equitable.
   There is no evidence of glaciation during this time. Palm trees in fact have been found in
   Cretaceous sediments as far north as Alaska, and numerous plants with tropical affinities today
   were common throughout the Aquilapollenites province. Near the end of the Cretaceous a slight
   global cooling began.

  The Great Cretaceous Mass Extinction | Back to Top

   The sudden disappearance of the dinosaurs has long been known to paleontologists. Numerous
   attempts have been made to explain this, with two major ideas having the largest amounts of
   evidence. Sixty-five million years ago nearly 75-80% of all species of life on Earth were wiped
   out in an incredibly short period of time. In addition to dinosaurs, pterosaurs, belemnoids,
   many species of plants (such as the plant that produced Aquilapollenites type pollen),
   ammonites, marine reptiles, and rudist bivalves also disappeared.

   The major mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. Image from
   http://www.carleton.ca/~tpatters/teaching/intro/extinction/extinction1.html.

   Among the various hypotheses to explain the extinction that closed the Mesozoic era were
   allergies by dinosaurs to pollen produced by flowering plants, increased radiation levels that
   led to male dinosaur sterility, diseases brought by migrating animals, and a gradual climate
   deterioration that the dinosaurs were unable to cope with. The first hypothesis ignores the fact
   that flowering plants and dinosaurs had coexisted for over 70 million years at the time of the
   mass extinction. Increased radiation levels would not cause the extinction of many of the plant
   species, nor do we know if male dinosaurs carried their gonads outside their bodies. The
   migration hypothesis does have some merit. We know, for example, that introduction of a new
   animal group to an area will cause ecologoical realignments, as well as ossibly bring disease to
   an area. Sheep in Iceland, for example, were severely affected by a virus brought along with new
   sheep from Europe. The icelandic sheep had no resistance to this virus (although the european
   newcomers did). The suggestion that dinosaurs went extinct because they were unable to cope with
   a cooling had merit when we viewed all dinosaurs as little more than large ectothermic lizards.
   The modern view of dinosaurs suggests they were quite well adapted to their environments, and
   although the diversity of dinosaurs shows a drop approaching the end of the Cretaceous, that
   those dinosaurs that existed, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, were well suited to
   their environments.

   In 1980, physics Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez (1911 - 1988) with his son, Berkeley geology
   professorWalter Alvarez (born in 1940), and their coworkers proposed a wild idea: an asteroid
   had hit the earth 65 million years ago and triggered a series oif events that culminated in the
   mass extinction that ended the age of dinosaurs. Their discovery of unusually high levels of the
   rare metal iridium at the boundary layer between the Cretaceous and the Tertiary periods led to
   a conclusion that the extinction was caused by a 10 km asteroid. Iridium is a rare metal at the
   Earth's surface, but is known to occur at impact sites, and is also thought to occur deep within
   the Earth. The major flaw in the hypothesis at that time was the lack of a suitably large impact
   structure of the correct age. In 1991 a team of other scientists found evidence of just such a
   crater buried off the coast of the villiage of Chicxulub in Yucatan, Mexico. Consequences of the
   impact were profound. The immense amounts of material ejected from the crater into the
   atmosphere blocked or reduced sunlight levels, effectively shutting down the process of
   photosynthesis that is the basis of all food webs. The vaporization of rocks at impact
   contributed sulfur and nitric acids, which had a severe acid rain effect of vegetation and
   marine environments. Shocked quartz grains, usually considered diagnostic of an impact site (or
   a nuclear test site), have been found associated with these deposits.

   The competing hypothesis is that intense flood volcanism in India greatly altered the clomate in
   a very brief time and led to the mass extinction. The Indian deposits are known as the Deccan
   Traps. Geochemical age dating of the basalts that comprise the Traps support the major eruptive
   phase of the Traps at the same time the Cretaceous mass extinction occurred. While volcanic
   eruptions, such as those at Hawaii, do bring iridium to the surface, they do not produce shocked
   quartz.
