   The ability to reproduce is one of the unifying characteristics of all living things. Sexual
   reproduction produces offspring that are genetically different from their parents. Asexual
   reproduction produces offspring genetically identical to their parent.

  Asexual Reproduction | Back to Top

   Fission, budding, fragmentation, and the formation of rhizomes and stolons are some of the
   mechanisms that allow organisms to reproduce asexually. The hydra produces buds; starfish can
   regenerate an entire body from a fragment of the original body. Asexual reproduction allows an
   organism to rapidly produce many offspring without the time and resources committed to
   courtship, finding a mate, and mating. The lack of genetic variability in asexually reproducing
   populations can be detrimental when environmental conditions (for which all the clones are so
   well adapted) change quickly.

  Sexual Reproduction | Back to Top

   In sexual reproduction new individuals are produced by the fusion of haploid gametes to form a
   diploid zygote. Sperm are male gametes, ova (ovum singular) are female gametes. Meiosis produces
   cells that are genetically distinct from each other; fertilization is the fusion of two such
   distinctive cells that produces a unique new combination of alleles, thus increasing variation
   on which natural selection can operate.

   Rotifers will reproduce asexually when conditions are favorable by having females produce eggs
   by mitosis. When conditions deteriorate, rotifers will reproduce sexually and encase their
   zygotes inside a resistant shell. Once conditions improve, these eggs hatch into diploid
   individuals. Rotifers thus use sexual reproduction as way to survive a deteriorating
   environment.

   Sexual reproduction offers the benefit of generating genetic variation among offspring, which
   enhances the chances of the population's survival. Costs of this process include the need for
   two individuals to mate, courtship rituals, as well as a number of basic mechanisms described
   later.

  Human Reproduction and Development | Back to Top

   Human reproduction employs internal fertilization, and depends on the integrated action of
   hormones, the nervous system, and the reproductive system. Gonads are sex organs that produce
   gametes. Male gonads are the testes, which produce sperm and male sex hormones. Female gonads
   are the ovaries, which produce eggs (ova) and female sex hormones.

    The Male Reproductive System

   Testes are suspended outside the abdominal cavity by the scrotum, a pouch of skin that keeps the
   testes close or far from the body at an optimal temperature for sperm development. Seminiferous
   tubules are inside each testis, and are where sperm are produced by meiosis. About 250 meters
   (850 feet) of tubules are packed into each testis. Spermatocytes inside the tubules divide by
   meiosis to produce spermatids that in turn develop into mature sperm.

                                          [malerepro_1.gif]

    Spermatogenesis

   Sperm production begins at puberty at continues throughout life, with several hundred million
   sperm being produced each day. Once sperm form they move into the epididymis, where they mature
   and are stored.

                                             [97086a.jpg]

    Male Sex Hormones

   The anterior pituitary produces follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).
   Action of LH is controlled by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). LH stimulates cells in
   the seminiferous tubules to secrete testosterone, which has a role in sperm production and
   developing male secondary sex characteristics. FSH acts on cells to help in sperm maturation.
   Negative feedback by testosterone controls the actions of GnRH.

    Sexual Structures

   Sperm pass through the vas deferens and connect to a short ejaculatory duct that connects to the
   urethra. The urethra passes through the penis and opens to the outside. Secretions from the
   seminal vesicles add fructose and prostaglandins to sperm as they pass. The prostate gland
   secretes a milky alkaline fluid. The bulbourethral gland secretes a mucus-like fluid that
   provides lubrication for intercourse. Sperm and secretions make up semen.

    The Female Reproductive System

   The female gonads, ovaries, are located within the lower abdominal cavity.

                                         [femalerepro_1.gif]

   The ovary contains many follicles composed of a developing egg surrounded by an outer layer of
   follicle cells. Each egg begins oogenesis as a primary oocyte. At birth each female carries a
   lifetime supply of developing oocytes, each of which is in Prophase I. A developing egg
   (secondary oocyte) is released each month from puberty until menopause, a total of 400-500 eggs.

                                            [femrep1.gif]

   Oogenesis. The above image is from http://www.grad.ttuhsc.edu/courses/histo/notes/female.html.

    Ovarian Cycles

   After puberty the ovary cycles between a follicular phase (maturing follicles) and a luteal
   phase (presence of the corpus luteum). These cyclic phases are interrupted only by pregnancy and
   continue until menopause, when reproductive capability ends. The ovarian cycle lasts usually 28
   days. During the first phase, the oocyte matures within a follicle. At midpoint of the cycle,
   the oocyte is released from the ovary in a process known as ovulation. Following ovulation the
   follicle forms a corpus luteum which synthesizes and prepares hormones to prepare the uterus for
   pregnancy.

   The secondary oocyte passes into the oviduct (fallopian tube or uterine tube). The oviduct is
   connected to the uterus.

   The uterus has an inner layer, the endometrium, in which a fertilized egg implants. At the lower
   end of the uterus the cervix connects the uterus to the vagina. The vagina receives the penis
   during intercourse and serves as the birth canal.

    External Genitals

   The female external genitals are collectively known as the vulva. The labia minora is a thin
   membrane of folded skin just outside the vaginal opening. The labia majora cover and protect the
   genital area. A clitoris, important in arousal, is a short shaft with a sensitive tip covered by
   a fold of skin.

    Hormones and Female Cycles

   The ovarian cycle is hormonally regulated in two phases. The follicle secretes estrogen before
   ovulation; the corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone after ovulation. Hormones
   from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary control the ovarian cycle. The ovarian cycle covers
   events in the ovary; the menstrual cycle occurs in the uterus.

                                         [FEMHORMONEFBK.gif]

   Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   Menstrual cycles vary from between 15 and 31 days. The first day of the cycle is the first day
   of blood flow (day 0) known as menstruation. During menstruation the uterine lining is broken
   down and shed as menstrual flow. FSH and LH are secreted on day 0, beginning both the menstrual
   cycle and the ovarian cycle. Both FSH and LH stimulate the maturation of a single follicle in
   one of the ovaries and the secretion of estrogen. Rising levels of estrogen in the blood trigger
   secretion of LH, which stimulates follicle maturation and ovulation (day 14, or midcycle). LH
   stimulates the remaining follicle cells to form the corpus luteum, which produces both estrogen
   and progesterone. Click here to view a "movie" of the hormone sequences.

   Estrogen and progesterone stimulate the development of the endometrium and preparation of the
   uterine inner lining for implantation of a zygote. If pregnancy does not occur, the drop in FSH
   and LH cause the corpus luteum to disintegrate. The drop in hormones also causes the sloughing
   off of the inner lining of the uterus by a series of muscle contractions of the uterus.

  Sexual Responses | Back to Top

   Humans do not have a mating season , females are sexually receptive to the male at all times of
   the year. There are four stages in mating: arousal, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

   During male arousal, blood flows into the three shafts of spongy erectile tissue inside the
   penis, causing it to become elongated and erect. The female arousal has the swelling of the
   areas around the vagina, erection of the clitoris and nipples, and secretion of lubricating
   fluids in the vagina.

   After insertion of the penis into the vagina, pelvic thrusts by both partners stimulate sensory
   receptors in the penis, vaginal walls, and clitoris. The sperm leave the epididymis and
   secretions of glands form the semen. Orgasm involves contractions of muscles of the penis (male)
   or vagina (female) and waves of pleasurable sensations.

   Resolution reverses the previous phases: muscles relax, breathing slows, the penis returns to
   its normal size.

  Sexually Transmitted Diseases | Back to Top

   Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) cause over $7 billion to be expended for treatment. STDs
   can affect the sex partners, fetus, and newborn infants. STDs are grouped into three categories.

    Category One

   STDs that produce inflammation of the urethra, epididymis, cervix, or oviducts. Gonorrhea and
   chlamydia are the most common STDs in this category. Both diseases can be treated and cured with
   antibiotics, once diagnosed.

    Category Two

   STDs that produce sores on the external genitals. Genital herpes is the most common disease in
   this class, affecting more than 25 million individuals in the US. Symptoms of herpes can be
   treated by antiviral drugs, but the infection cannot be cured. Syphilis is a bacterially caused
   infection, and can, if left untreated, cause serious symptoms and death. However, the disease is
   curable with antibiotics.

    Category Three

   This class of STDs includes viral diseases that affect organ systems other than those of the
   reproductive system. AIDS and hepatitis B are in this category. Both can be spread by sexual
   contact or blood. Infectious individuals may appear symptom-free for years after infection.

  Reproduction: New and Improved? | Back to Top

   New techniques have been developed to enhance or reduce the chances of conception. Social
   conventions and governing laws have developed far slower than this new technology, leading to
   controversy about moral, ethical, and legal grounds for the uses of such technologies.

   The separation of intercourse from pregnancy uses methods blocking one of the three stages of
   reproduction"
     * release and transport of gametes
     * fertilization
     * implantation

    Effectiveness

   Various contraceptive methods have been developed; none of which is 100% successful at
   preventing pregnancy or the transmission of STDs. Abstinence is the only completely effective
   method.

    Methods

   Physical prevention (most effective) include vasectomy and tubal ligation. Vasectomy: the vas
   deferens connecting the testes with the urethra is cut and sealed to prevent the transport of
   sperm. Tubal ligation: the oviduct is cut and ends tied off to prevent eggs from reaching the
   uterus.

                                           [vasectomy.gif]

   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with
   permission.

   Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) usually contain a combination of hormones that prevent
   release of FSH and LH, inhibiting development of the follicle so that no oocytes are released.
   Time-release capsules (Norplant) can be implanted under the skin and offer long-term suppression
   of ovulation. RU-486, the so-called morning after pill, interferes with implantation of the
   blastula into the uterine wall. Its use as a contraceptive is very controversial.

   Barrier methods employ physical (condom, diaphragm) or chemical (spermacides) means to separate
   the sperm from the egg. Male condoms are fitted over the erect penis; female condoms are placed
   inside the vagina. Only latex condoms prevent the spread of STDs. Diaphragms cap the cervix and
   block passage of the sperm into the uterus. Spermicidal jellies or foams kill sperm on contact
   and must be placed in the vagina prior to intercourse.

    Reproductive Technologies Can Enhance Fertility

   About 1 in 6 couples is infertile due to physical or physiological conditions preventing gamete
   production, implantation, or fertilization. Blocked oviducts (often from untreated STDs) are the
   leading cause of infertility in females. Low sperm count, low motility, or blocked ducts are
   common causes of male infertility.

   Hormone therapy can cause increased egg production. Surgery can open blocked ducts. About 40 of
   the cases are due to male problems, 40 due to female problems and the remaining 20% are caused
   by some unknown agent(s). In vitro fertilization (test-tube babies) is a widely used technique
   to aid infertile couples.

  Fertilization and Cleavage | Back to Top

   Fertilization has three functions:
    1. transmission of genes from both parents to offspring
    2. restoration of the diploid number of chromosomes reduced during meiosis
    3. initiation of development in offspring

    Steps in Fertilization

     * Contact between sperm and egg
     * Entry of sperm into the egg
     * Fusion of egg and sperm nuclei
     * Activation of development

    Cleavage

   Cleavage is the first step in development of ALL multicelled organisms. Cleavage converts a
   single-celled zygote into a multicelled embryo by mitosis. Usually, the zygotic cytoplasm is
   divided among the newly formed cells. Frog embryos divide to produce 37,000 cells in a little
   over 40 hours.

   The blastula is produced by mitosis of the zygote, and is a ball of cells surrounding a
   fluid-filled cavity (the blastocoel). The decreasing size of cells increases their surface to
   volume ratio, allowing for more efficient oxygen exchange between cells and their environment.
   RNA and information carrying molecules are distributed to various parts of the blastula, and
   this molecular differentiation sets the stage for the layering of the body in the next phases of
   development.

  Gastrulation | Back to Top

   Gastrulation involves a series of cell migrations to positions where they will form the three
   primary cell layers.
     * Ectoderm forms the outer layer.
     * Endoderm forms the inner layer.
     * Mesoderm forms the middle layer.

    Ectoderm

   Ectoderm forms tissues associated with outer layers: skin, hair, sweat glands, epithelium. The
   brain and nervous system also develop from the ectoderm.

    Mesoderm

   The mesoderm forms structures associated with movement and support: body muscles, cartilage,
   bone, blood, and all other connective tissues. Reproductive system organs and kidneys form from
   mesoderm.

    Endoderm

   The endoderm forms tissues and organs associated with the digestive and respiratory systems.
   Many endocrine structures, such as the thyroid and parathyroid glands, are formed by the
   endoderm. The liver, pancreas, and gall bladder arise from endoderm.

    Invagination

   Immediately after gastrulation, the body axis of the embryo begins to appear. Chordates have the
   cells that will form the nervous system fold into a neural tube (which will eventually form the
   spinal cord). The mesoderm forms the notochord (which will eventually form the vertebrae). The
   mesoderm at this time forms somites, which form segmented body parts, such as the muscles of the
   body wall.

  Pattern Formation and Induction | Back to Top

   Blastulation and gastrulation establish the main body axis. Organ formation occurs in the next
   stage of the development of the embryo. During organ formation, cell division is accomplished by
   migration and aggregation.

   Pattern formation is the result of cells "sensing" their position in the embryo relative to
   other cells and to form structures appropriate to that position. Gradients of informational
   molecules within the embryo have been suggested to provide the positional information to cells.
   Homeobox genes are pattern genes; they coordinate with gradients of information molecules to
   establish the body plan and development of organs.

   Induction is the process in which one cell or tissue type affects the developmental fate of
   another cell or tissue. As a cell begins to form certain structures, certain genes are turned
   on, others are turned off. Induction affects patterns of gene expression through physical
   contact or chemical signals. Formation of the vertebrate eye is a well known example.

  Human Development | Back to Top

   Fertilization, the fusion of the sperm and egg, usually occurs in the upper third of the
   oviduct. Thirty minutes after ejaculation, sperm are present in the oviduct, having traveled
   from the vagina through the uterus and into the oviduct. Sperm traverse this distance by the
   beating of their flagellum. Of the several hundred million sperm released in the ejaculation,
   only a few thousand reach the egg.

   Only one sperm will fertilize the egg. One sperm fuses with receptors on the surface of the
   secondary oocyte, triggering a series of chemical changes in the outer oocyte membrane that
   prevent any other sperm from entering the oocyte. The entry of the sperm initiates Meiosis II in
   the oocyte. Fusion of the egg and sperm nuclei forms the diploid zygote.

    Travels of a Young Zygote

   Cleavage of the zygote begins while it is still in the oviduct, producing a solid ball of cells
   (morula). The morula enters the uterus, continuing to divide and becomes a blastocyst.


    Implantation

   The uterine lining becomes enlarged and prepared for implantation of the embryo in the
   trophoblast layer. Twelve days after fertilization, the trophoblast has formed a two-layered
   chorion. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is secreted by the chorion, and prolongs the life of
   the corpus luteum until the placenta begins to secrete estrogen and progesterone. Home pregnancy
   tests work by detecting elevated hCG levels in the woman's urine.

    Your Placenta or Mine?

   Maternal and embryonic structures interlock to form the placenta, the nourishing boundary
   between the mother's and embryo's systems. The umbilical cord extends from the placenta to the
   embryo, and transports food to and wastes from the embryo.

    Stages

   The period of time from fertilization to birth (usually 9 months) is divided into trimesters,
   each about three months long. During pregnancy the zygote undergoes 40 to 44 rounds of mitosis,
   producing an infant containing trillions of specialized cells organized into tissues and organs.

    The First Trimester

   The three embryonic tissue layers form. Cellular differentiation begins to form organs during
   the third week. After one month the embryo is 5 mm long and composed mostly of paired somite
   segments. During the second month most of the major organ systems form, limb buds develop. The
   embryo becomes a fetus by the seventh week. Beginning the eighth week, the sexually neutral
   fetus activates gene pathways for sex determination, forming testes in XY fetuses and ovaries in
   XX fetuses. External genitalia develop.

    The Second Trimester

   The fetus increases in size during this trimester, and bony parts of the skeleton begin to form.
   Fetal movements can be felt by the mother.

    The Last Trimester

   During this trimester the fetus increases in size. Circulatory and respiratory systems mature in
   preparation for air breathing. Fetal growth during this time uses large parts of its mother's
   protein and calcium intake. Maternal antibodies pass to the fetus during the last month,
   conferring temporary immunity.

  Birth | Back to Top

   Birth is a positive feedback hormonal mechanism. During birth the cervix dilates to allow
   passage of the fetus. Uterine contractions propel the fetus through the birth canal, usually
   head first. Hormonal control of the birth process involves the release of oxytocin and
   prostaglandins, which are stimulated by uterine contractions, which stimulate more hormones that
   cause more contractions....etc.

    First Stage

   The first stage of birth lasts from beginning of contractions to the full (10 cm) dilation of
   the cervix. Membranes of the amniotic fluid rupture, lubricating the vagina.

    Second Stage

   Strong uterine contractions of a minute in duration separated by two to three minute intervals
   propel the fetus down the birth canal. Abdominal muscles relax in synchrony with the uterine
   contractions.

    Third Stage

   After delivery of the baby, the umbilical cord is clipped and cut. The placenta (or afterbirth)
   in expelled through the vagina.

    Milk Production

   Nursing mothers have their hormone levels and uterine size return to normal much faster than
   non-nursing mothers. Breasts develop the capability for milk secretion about the mid point of
   pregnancy. Secretion of milk does not occur until delivery, and the action of prolactin.
   Suckling by the infant causes production of oxytocin to promote release of milk into the ducts
   emptying into the nipple.

  Landmarks | Back to Top

   The stages of life are noted by the acquisition of social, physical, and mental skills. Other
   signs of maturation include tattoos, body piercing, motorcycles, and backward-turned baseball
   caps.

    Infancy and Childhood

   Infancy lasts from birth until age two. Infant reflexes concern finding the nipple: suckling can
   occur minutes after birth, and the rooting reflex is a tactile clue for the infant to turn its
   head toward a touch. During the first year the infant passes through a series of developmental
   stages.

   Childhood begins at two and lasts until puberty. Physical growth is accompanied by increasing
   development of motor and language skills. Play, make-believe, and increases in memory and
   attention span also occur.

    Adolescence and Adulthood

   Growth accelerates during puberty. Boys increase in height by 3-5 inches per year, girls 2-4
   inches. The heart doubles in size, and hormones stimulate sexual maturity. Growth ends during
   the end of adolescence, and aging starts during the late twenties. Life expectancy (47 and 50
   years for males and females in 1900; 74 and 81 in 1996) has increased.
