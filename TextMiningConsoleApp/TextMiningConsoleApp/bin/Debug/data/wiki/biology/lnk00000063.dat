  Origin of the Earth and Life | Back to Top

   Scientific estimates place the origin of the Universe at between 10 and 20 billion years ago.
   The theory currently with the most acceptance is the Big Bang Theory, the idea that all matter
   in the Universe existed in a cosmic egg (smaller than the size of a modern hydrogen atom) that
   exploded, forming the Universe. Recent discoveries from the Space Telescope and other devices
   suggest this theory smay need some modification. Evidence for the Big Bang includes:

     1) The Red Shift: when stars/galaxies are moving away from us the energy they emit is shifted
     to the red side of the visible-light spectrum. Those moving towards us are shifted to the
     violet side. This shift is an example of the Doppler effect. Similar effects are observed
     when listening to a train whistle-- it will sound higher (shorter wavelengths) approaching
     and lower (longer wavelengths) as it moves away. Likewise red wavelengths are longer than
     violet ones. Most galaxies appear to be moving away from ours.

     2) Background radiation: two Bell Labs scientists discovered that in interstellar space there
     is a slight background radiation, thought to be the residual afterblast remnant of the Big
     Bang.

   Soon after the Big Bang the major forces (such as gravity, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear
   force, etc.) differentiated. While in the cosmic egg, scientists think that matter and energy as
   we understand them did not exist, but rather they formed soon after the bang. After 10 million
   to 1 billion years the universe became clumpy, with matter beginning to accumulate into solar
   systems. One of those solar systems, ours, began to form approximately 5 billion years ago, with
   a large "protostar" (that became our sun) in the center. The planets were in orbits some
   distance from the star, their increasing gravitational fields sweeping stray debris into larger
   and larger planetesimals that eventually formed planets.

   The processes of radioactive decay and heat generated by the impact of planetesimals heated the
   Earth, which then began to differentiate into a "cooled" outer cooled crust (of silicon, oxygen
   and other relatively light elements) and increasingly hotter inner areas (composed of the
   heavier and denser elements such as iron and nickel). Impact (asteroid, comet, planetismals) and
   the beginnings of volcanism released water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and other
   gases into a developing atmosphere. Sometime "soon" after this, life on earth began.

  Where did life originate and how?

   Extra-terrestrial: In 1969, a meteorite (left-over bits from the origin of the solar system)
   landed near Allende, Mexico. The Allende Meteorite (and others of its sort) have been analyzed
   and found to contain amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, one of the four organic
   molecule groups basic to all life. The idea of panspermia hypothesized that life originated out
   in space and came to earth inside a meteorite. Recently, this idea has been revived as Cosmic
   Ancestry. The amino acids recovered from meteorites are in a group known as exotics: they do not
   occur in the chemical systems of living things. The ET theory is now not considered by most
   scientists to be correct, although the August 1996 discovery of the Martian meteorite and its
   possible fossils have revived thought of life elsewhere in the Solar System.

   Supernatural: Since science is an attempt to measure and study the natural world, this theory is
   outside science (at least our current understanding of science). Science classes deal with
   science, and this idea is in the category of not-science.

   Organic Chemical Evolution: Until the mid-1800's scientists thought organic chemicals (those
   with a C-C skeleton) could only form by the actions of living things. A French scientist heated
   crystals of a mineral (a mineral is by definition inorganic), and discovered that they formed
   urea (an organic chemical) when they cooled. Russian scientist and academecian A.I. Oparin, in
   1922, hypothesized that cellular life was preceeded by a period of chemical evolution. These
   chemicals, he argued, must have arisen spontaneously under conditions exisitng billions of years
   ago (and quite unlike current conditions).

                                           [Millers_1.gif]

   In 1950, then-graduate student Stanley Miller designed an experimental test for Oparin's
   hypothesis. Oparin's original hypothesis called for : 1) little or no free oxygen (oxygen not
   bonded to other elements); and 2) C H O and N in abundance. Studies of modern volcanic eruptions
   support inference of the existence of such an atmosphere. Miller discharged an electric spark
   into a mixture thought to resemble the primordial composition of the atmosphere. From the water
   receptacle, designed to model an ancient ocean, Miller recovered amino acids. Subsequent
   modifications of the atmosphere have produced representatives or precursors of all four organic
   macromolecular classes.

   The primordial Earth was a very different place than today, with greater amounts of energy,
   stronger storms, etc. The oceans were a "soup" of organic compounds that formed by inorganic
   processes (although this soup would not taste umm ummm good). Miller's (and subsequent)
   experiments have not proven life originated in this way, only that conditions thought to have
   existed over 3 billion years ago were such that the spontaneous (inorganic) formation of organic
   macromolecules could have taken place. The simple inorganic molecules that Miller placed into
   his apparatus, produced a variety of complex molecules:

                                         [millersatmo_2.gif]

                                           [millersO_3.gif]

                                           [millersO_4.gif]

   Molecules recovered from Miller's and similar experiments. Image from Purves et al., Life: The
   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   The interactions of these molecules would have increased as their concentrations increased.
   Reactions would have led to the building of larger, more complex molecules. A pre-cellular life
   would have began with the formation of nucleic acids. Chemicals made by these nucleic acids
   would have remained in proximity to the nucleic acids. Eventually the pre-cells would have been
   enclosed in a lipid-protein membrane, which would have resulted in the first cells.

   Biochemically, living systems are separated from other chemical systems by three things.
    1. The capacity for replication from one generation to another. Most organisms today use DNA as
       the hereditary material, although recent evidence (ribozymes) suggests that RNA may have
       been the first nucleic acid system to have formed. Nobel laureate Walter Gilbert refers to
       this as the RNA world.
    2. The presence of enzymes and other complex molecules essential to the processes needed by
       living systems. Miller's experiment showed how these could possibly form.
    3. A membrane that separates the internal chemicals from the external chemical environment.
       This also delimits the cell from not-cell areas. The work of Sidney W. Fox has produced
       proteinoid spheres, which while not cells, suggest a possible route from chemical to
       cellular life.

   Fossil evidence supports the origins of life on earth earlier than 3.5 billion years ago. The
   North Pole microfossils from Australia (the Apex Chert) are complex enough that more primitive
   cells must have existed earlier. From rocks of the Ishua Super Group in Greenland come possibly
   the earliest cells, as much as 3.8 billion years old. The oldest known rocks on Earth are 3.96
   billion years old and are from Arctic Canada. Thus, life appears to have begun soon after the
   cooling of the Earth and formation of the atmosphere and oceans.

   These ancient fossils occur in marine rocks, such as limestones and sandstones, that formed in
   ancient oceans. The organisms living today that are most similar to ancient life forms are the
   archaebacteria. This group is today restricted to marginal environments. Recent discoveries of
   bacteria at mid-ocean ridges add yet another possible origin for life: at these mid-ocean
   geological structures where heat and molten rock rise to the Earth's surface.

Is there life on Mars, Venus, anywhere else?? | Back to Top

   The proximity of the earth to the sun, the make-up of the earth's crust (silicate mixtures,
   presence of water, etc.) and the size of the earth suggest we may be unique in our own solar
   system, at least. Mars is smaller, farther from the sun, has a lower gravitational field (which
   would keep the atmosphere from escaping into space) and does show evidence of running water
   sometime in its past. If life did start on Mars, however, there appears to be no life (as we
   know it) today. Venus, the second planet, is closer to the sun, and appears similar to earth in
   many respects. Carbon dioxide build-up has resulted in a "greenhouse planet" with strong storms
   and strongly acidic rain. Of all planets in the solar system, Venus is most likely to have some
   form of C-based life. The outer planets are as yet too poorly understood, although it seems
   unlikely that Jupiter or Saturn harbor life as we know it. Like Goldilocks would say "Venus is
   too hot, Mars is too cold, the Earth is just right!"

   Mars: In August 1996, evidence of life on Mars (or at least the chemistry of life), was
   announced. Click here to view that article and related ones. The results of years of study are
   inconclusive at best. The purported bacteria are much smaller than any known bacteria on earth,
   were not hollow, and most could possibly have been mineral in origin. However, many scientists
   consider that the chemistry of life appears to have been established on Mars. Search for Martian
   life (or its remains) continues.

The Origins of Multicellularity | Back to Top

   The oldest accepted prokaryote fossils date to 3.5 billion years; Eukaryotic fossils to between
   750 million years and possibly as old as 1.2-1.5 billion years. Multicellular fossils,
   purportedly of animals, have been recovered from 750Ma rocks in various parts of the world. The
   first eukaryotes were undoubtedly Protistans, a group that is thought to have given rise to the
   other eukaryotic kingdoms. Multicellularity allows specialization of function, for example
   muscle fibers are specialized for contraction, neuron cells for transmission of nerve messages.

  The Precambrian | Back to Top

   The Archean Eon encompasses the time from the formation of the earth until 2.5 billion years
   ago. The rocks formed during this eon are the most ancient rocks known, up to 3.96 billion years
   old. The nature of this rock inducates that there were/are even older rocks that, if they still
   exist, have yet to be located and dated. Perhaps the biggest development during the Archean was
   the first appearance of life. The earliest forms of life were simple prokaryotic cells, in a few
   cases remarkably similar to living prokaryotic forms (at least in terms of observable cell
   structure and size). Fossil evidence supports the origins of life on earth earlier than 3.5
   billion years ago. Specimens from the North Pole region of Western Australia are of such
   diversity and apparent complexity that even more primitive cells must have existed earlier.
   Rocks of the Ishua Super Group in Greenland yield possibly the fossil remains of the earliest
   cells, 3.8 billion years old. Life appears to have begun soon after the cooling of the Earth and
   formation of its atmosphere and oceans.

   These ancient fossils occur in marine rocks, such as limestones and sandstones, that formed in
   ancient oceans. The organisms living today that are most similar to ancient life forms are the
   archaebacteria (the archaea in modern usage). This group is today restricted to marginal
   environments. Recent discoveries of life at mid-ocean ridges add yet another possible place of
   origin: at these mid-ocean ridges where heat and molten rock rise to the earth's surface.

   Archaea and Eubacteria are similar in size and shape. When we do recover fossilized bacteria
   those are the two features we will usually see: size and shape. How can we distinguish between
   the two groups: the use of molecular fossils that will point to either (but not both) groups.
   Such a chemical fossil has been found and its presence in the Ishua rocks of Greenland (3.8
   billion years old) suggests that the archeans were present at that time.

   Many of the ancient phototrophs and heterotrophic bacteria lived in colonial associations known
   as stromatolites. Cyanobacteria occur on the outer surface, with other photosynthetic bacteria
   (anoxic, which do not produce oxygen from their photosynthesis process)) below them. Below these
   phototrophs are layers of heterotrophic bacteria. The layers in the stromatolites are
   alternating biogenic and sedimentologic in origin. Stromatolites become more common in the
   Proterozoic and decline during the Cambrian. Modern stromatolites are found in marine
   environments where the presence of herbivorous :grazers" is limited.

   approximately 3.5 billion years old. Image from

   The Proterozoic Eon covers the time span from 2.5 billion to 544 million years ago. Simple,
   prokaryotic cells still dominated the world's environments until the evolution of simple
   eukaryotes approximately 1.5-1.2 billion years ago. With the appearance of eukaryotes comes the
   development of sexual reproduction, which greatly increased the variation that natural selection
   could operate on. A major enbvironmental change, initiated by living things, was the development
   of oxygenic photosynthesis. This led to increasing oxygen levels during later Proterozoic.
   Geologists refer to the "great iron crisis" when the rising levels of oxygen in the world's
   oceans caused the formation or iron oxide (Fe[2]O[3]), often preserved as the banded iron
   formation (an important commercial source of iron).

   iron) and chert. Image from http://www.agso.gov.au/education/factsheet/ironform.html.

   The first protist (eukaryotic) fossils have commonly been thought to be in rocks approximately
   1.2-1.4 billion years old (Proterozoic) from the Bitter Springs Formation in Australia. The
   Bitter Springs deposits also yield a variety of bacteria and cyanobacterial types. Recent study
   of the Bitter Springs eukaryote fossils suggests they may in fact be cyanobactria. A group of
   undoubted eukaryote fossils is the "acritarchs". This term applies to resting cycts of
   single-celled algae. Acrtitarchs have been recovered from sediments that are as old as 1.8
   billion years.

   Multicellular protists appeared in the fossil record more than 600 million years ago near the
   very end of the precambrian. This time is referred to as the Vendian Period (650 to 544 million
   years ago), and is characterized by the appearance of soft-bodied animal fossils. Multicellular
   animal fossils and burrows (presumably made by unknown multicellular animals) first appear 700
   million years ago, during the late precambrian time. All known Proterozoic animal fossils had
   soft body parts: no shells or hard (and hence preservable as fossils) parts. There are some
   paleontologists who suspect that the Vendian faunas were reduced by an extinction event,
   possibly related to massive glaciation, at the close of the vendian time. In any event, many
   animals in the Vendian assemblages are quite unlike anything living today, while others can be
   traced to extant phyla.

   Some problemmatic fossils, thought by some paleobotanists to be multicellular algae, have been
   found in rocks approximately one billion years old. However, the multicellular algae are usually
   classified based on their pigments, which commonly are not preserved in the fossils.
