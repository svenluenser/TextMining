   The single-celled protozoan ancestors of animals had their weight supported by water and were
   able to move by cilia or other simple organelles. The evolution of large and more complex
   organisms (animals) necessitated the development of support and locomotion systems. Animals use
   their muscular and skeletal systems for support, locomotion, and maintaining their shape.

  Types of Skeletal Systems | Back to Top

   Movement is a major characteristic of animals. This movement is a result of contraction of
   muscles. The skeleton helps transmit that movement. Skeletons are either a fluid-filled body
   cavity, exoskeletons, or internal skeletons.

   Hydrostatic skeletons consist of fluid-filled closed chambers. Internal pressures generated by
   muscle contractions cause movement as well as maintain the shape of the animals, such as the sea
   anemone and worms. The sea anemone has one set of longitudinal muscles in the outer layer of the
   body, and a layer of circular muscles in the inner layer of the body. The anemone can elongate
   or contract its body by contracting one or the other set of muscles.

   Exoskeletons are characteristic of the Phylum Arthropoda. Exoskeletons are hard segments that
   cover the muscles and visceral organs. Muscles for movement attach to the inner surface of the
   exoskeleton. Exoskeletons restrict the growth of the animal, thus it must shed its exoskeleton
   (or molt) to form a new one that has room for growth. The bulk and weight of the exoskeleton and
   associated mechanical problems limits the size animals can attain. Spiders use a combination of
   an exoskeleton for protection and fluid pressure for movement.

   Vertebrates have developed an internal mineralized (in most cases) endoskeleton composed of bone
   and/or cartilage. Muscles are on the outside of the endoskeleton. Cartilage and bone are types
   of connective tissue. Sharks, and rays have skeletons composed entirely of cartilage; other
   vertebrates have an embryonic cartilage skeleton progressively replaced by bone as they mature
   and develop. Some areas of the human body, however, retain cartilage in the adult: in joints and
   flexible structures such as the ribs, trachea, nose and ears.

  Functions of Muscles and Bones | Back to Top

   The skeleton and muscles function together as the musculoskeletal system. This system (often
   treated as two separate systems, the muscular, and skeletal) plays an important homeostatic
   role: allowing the animal to move to more favorable external conditions. Certain cells in the
   bones produce immune cells as well as important cellular components of the blood. Bone also
   helps regulate blood calcium levels, serving as a calcium sink. Rapid muscular contraction is
   important in generating internal heat, another homeostatic function.

  The Axial and Appendicular Skeletons | Back to Top

   The axial skeleton consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage. The appendicular
   skeleton contains the bones of the appendages (limbs, wings, or flippers/fins), and the pectoral
   and pelvic girdles.

   The human skull, or cranium, has a number of individual bones tightly fitted together at
   immovable joints. At birth many of these joints are not completely sutured together as bone,
   leading to a number of "soft spots" or fontanels, which do not completely join until the age of
   14-18 months.

   The vertebral column has 33 individual vertebrae separated from each other by a cartilage disk.
   These disks allow a certain flexibility to the spinal column, although the disks deteriorate
   with age, producing back pain. The sternum is connected to all the ribs except the lower pair.
   Cartilage allows for the flexibility of the rib cage during breathing.

   The arms and legs are part of the appendicular skeleton. The upper bones of the limbs are
   single: humerus (arm) and femur (leg). Below a joint (elbow or knee), both limbs have a pair of
   bones (radius and ulna in the arms; tibia and fibula in legs) that connect to another joint
   (wrist or ankle). The carpals makeup the wrist joint; the tarsals are in the ankle joint. Each
   hand or foot ends in 5 digits (fingers or toes) composed of metacarpals (hands) or metatarsals
   (feet).

   Limbs are connected to the rest of the skeleton by collections of bones known as girdles. The
   pectoral girdle consists of the clavicle (collar bone) and scapula (shoulder blade). The humerus
   is joined to the pectoral girdle at a joint and is held in place by muscles and ligaments. A
   dislocated shoulder occurs when the end of the humerus slips out of the socket of the scapula,
   stretching ligaments and muscles. The pelvic girdle consists of two hipbones that form a hollow
   cavity, the pelvis. The vertebral column attaches to the top of the pelvis; the femur of each
   leg attaches to the bottom. The pelvic girdle in land animals transfers the weight of the body
   to the legs and feet. Pelvic girdles in fish, which have their weight supported by water, are
   primitive; land animals have more developed pelvic girdles. Pelvic girdles in bipeds are
   recognizable different from those or quadrupeds.

  Bone Tissue | Back to Top

   Although bones vary greatly in size and shape, they have certain structural similarities. Bones
   have cells embedded in a mineralized (calcium) matrix and collagen fibers. Compact bone forms
   the shafts of long bones; it also occurs on the outer side of the bone. Spongy bone forms the
   inner layer.

                                           [bonediagr.gif]

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   Compact bone has a series of Haversian canals around which concentric layers of bone cells
   (osteocytes) and minerals occur. New bone is formed by the osteocytes. The Haversian canals form
   a network of blood vessels and nerves that nourish and monitor the osteocytes.

   Spongy bone occurs at the ends of long bones and is less dense than compact bone. The spongy
   bone of the femur, humerus, and sternum contains red marrow, in which stem cells reproduce and
   form the cellular components of the blood and immune system. Yellow marrow, at the center of
   these bones, is used to store fats. The outer layer of the bones is known as the periosteum. The
   inner layer of the periosteum forms new bone or modifies existing bone to meet new conditions.
   It is rich in nerve endings and blood and lymphatic vessels. When fractures occur, the pain is
   carried to the brain by nerves running through the periosteum.

  Bone Growth | Back to Top

   Endochondral ossification is the process of converting the cartilage in embryonic skeletons into
   bone. Cartilage is deposited early in development into shapes resembling the bones-to-be. Cells
   inside this cartilage grow and begin depositing minerals.

   The spongy bone forms, and osteoblasts attach and lay down the mineral portions of spongy bone.
   Osteoclasts remove material from the center of the bone, forming the central cavity of the long
   bones. The perichondrium, a connective tissue, forms around the cartilage and begins forming
   compact bone while the above changes are occurring. Blood vessels form and grow into the
   perichondrium, transporting stem cells into the interior. Two bands of cartilage remain as the
   bone develops, one at each end of the bone. During childhood, this cartilage allows for growth
   and changes in the shape of bones. Eventually the elongation of the bones stops and the
   cartilage is all converted into bone.

   Bones continue to change as adults, to adapt to the stresses generated by physical activity.
   Exercise can increase the diameter and strength of bone; inactivity can decrease them. Age is a
   factor: osteoporosis is a disease that primarily affects older, postmenopausal women. Increasing
   calcium intake, reducing protein intake, exercise and low doses of estrogen are effective
   treatments for osteoporosis.

  Joints | Back to Top

   There are three types of joints: immovable, partly movable, and synovial. Immovable joints, like
   those connecting the cranial bones, have edges that tightly interlock. Partly movable joints
   allow some degree of flexibility and usually have cartilage between the bones; example:
   vertebrae. Synovial joints permit the greatest degree of flexibility and have the ends of bones
   covered with a connective tissue filled with synovial fluid; example: hip.

   The outer surface of the synovial joints contains ligaments that strengthen joints and hold
   bones in position. The inner surface (the synovial membrane) has cells producing synovial fluid
   that lubricates the joint and prevents the two cartilage caps on the bones from rubbing
   together. Some joints also have tendons (connective tissue linking muscles to bones). Bursae are
   small sacs filled with synovial fluid that reduce friction in the joint. The knee joint contains
   13 bursae

    Skeletal Disorders

   Injury, degenerative wear and tear, and inflammatory disorders affect joints. Sprains are common
   injuries that cause ligaments to rip of separate from the bone. Tendinitis (such as tennis
   elbow) and bursitis are inflammations of the tendon sheaths.

   Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition associated with the wearing away of the protective
   caps of cartilage covering the bone-ends. Bony growths or spurs develop as the cartilage
   degenerates, causing restriction of movement and pain. The cause is not known and may just be
   wear-and-tear associated with aging.

   Rheumatoid arthritis is a severely damaging arthritis that begins with inflammation and
   thickening of the synovial membrane followed by bone degeneration and disfigurement. More women
   than men are affected. There may be a genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis. Joint
   replacement may in some cases restore function.

  Skeletal Muscle Systems | Back to Top

   Vertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across
   joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work
   in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process
   known as antagonism.

   Muscles have both electrical and chemical activity. There is an electrical gradient across the
   muscle cell membrane: the outside is more positive than the inside. Stimulus causes an
   instantaneous reversal of this polarity, causing the muscle to contract (the mechanical
   characteristic) producing a twitch or movement.

    Skeletal Muscle Structure

   Muscle fibers are multinucleated, with the nuclei located just under the plasma membrane. Most
   of the cell is occupied by striated, thread-like myofibrils. Within each myofibril there are
   dense Z lines. A sarcomere (or muscle functional unit) extends from Z line to Z line. Each
   sarcomere has thick and thin filaments. The thick filaments are made of myosin and occupy the
   center of each sarcomere. Thin filaments are made of actin and anchor to the Z line.

                                            [muscle2.gif]

   Muscles contract by shortening each sarcomere. The sliding filament model of muscle contraction
   has thin filaments on each side of the sarcomere sliding past each other until they meet in the
   middle. Myosin filaments have club-shaped heads that project toward the actin filaments.

                                            [muscle3.gif]

   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   Myosin heads attach to binding sites on the actin filaments. The myosin heads swivel toward the
   center of the sarcomere, detach and then reattach to the nearest active site of the actin
   filament. Each cycle of attachment, swiveling, and detachment shortens the sarcomere 1%.
   Hundreds of such cycles occur each second during muscle contraction.

                                            [muscle4.gif]

   Energy for this comes from ATP, the energy coin of the cell. ATP binds to the cross bridges
   between myosin heads and actin filaments. The release of energy powers the swiveling of the
   myosin head. Muscles store little ATP and so must recycle the ADP into ATP rapidly. Creatine
   phosphate is a muscle storage product involved in the rapid regeneration of ADP into ATP.

   Calcium ions are required for each cycle of myosin-actin interaction. Calcium is released into
   the sarcomere when a muscle is stimulated to contract. This calcium uncovers the actin binding
   sites. When the muscle no longer needs to contract, the calcium ions are pumped from the
   sarcomere and back into storage.

    Control of Muscle Contraction

   Neuromuscular junctions are the point where a motor neuron attaches to a muscle. Acetylcholine
   is released from the axon end of the nerve cell when a nerve impulse reaches the junction. A
   wave of electrical changes are produced in the muscle cell when the acetylcholine binds to
   receptors on its surface. Calcium is released from its storage area in the cell's endoplasmic
   reticulum. An impulse from a nerve cell causes calcium release and brings about a single, short
   muscle contraction called a twitch.

   Skeletal muscles are organized into hundreds of motor units, each of which is a motor neuron and
   a group of muscle fibers. A graded response to a circumstance will involve controlling the
   number of motor units. While individual muscle units contract as a unit, the entire muscle can
   contract on a graded basis due to their organization into motor units.

  Contraction of Nonmuscular Cells | Back to Top

   Actin and myosin, whose interaction causes muscle contraction, occur in many other cells. Actin
   is attached to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. The interaction of cytoplasmic myosin
   and this actin causes contraction of the cell, such a the coordinated contractions of intestinal
   cells to absorb nutrients.

   Some fish have modified muscles that discharge electricity. These fish have electric organs
   consisting of modified muscles known as electroplates. The South American electric eel has more
   than 6000 plates arranged into 70 columns. Maximum discharge is 100 watts.

  Interaction of the Two Systems | Back to Top

   Vertebrates move by application of the principles of the lever. Levers amplify or increase the
   force or velocity of motion. The amount of amplification depends on the length of the lever.
   There are three types of skeletal system, all interact with muscles using the lever.
