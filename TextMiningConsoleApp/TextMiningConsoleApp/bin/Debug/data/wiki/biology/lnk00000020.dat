   race  A subdivision of a species that is capable of interbreeding with other members of the
   species.

   radially symmetrical  In animals, refers to organisms with their body parts arranged around a
   central axis. Such animals tend to be circular or cylindrical in shape.

   radiation  Energy emitted from the unstable nuclei of radioactive isotopes.

   radioactive decay The spontaneous decay of an atom to an atom of a different element by emission
   of a particle from its nucleus (alpha and beta decay) or by electron capture.

   radioisotope Term applied to a radioactive isotope, such as carbon-14 or uranium 238.
   Radioisotope nuclei are unstable and spontaneously breakdown and emit one of a number of types
   of radiation.

   radiometric time Type of absolute time determined by the relative porportions of radioisotopes
   to stable daughter isotopes.

   ray-finned  Taxonomic group of fish, such as trout, tuna, salmon, and bass, that have thin, bony
   supports holding the Þns away from the body and an internal swim bladder that changes the
   buoyancy of the body; one of the two main types of bony Þshes.

   reabsorption  The return to the blood of most of the water, sodium, amino acids, and sugar that
   were removed during Þltration; occurs mainly in the proximal tubule of the nephron.

   receptacle  The base that attaches a þower to the stem. PICTURE

   receptor Protein on or protruding from the cell surface to which select chemicals can bind. The
   opiate receptor in brain cells allows both the natural chemical as well as foreign (opiate)
   chemicals to bind.

   recessive  Refers to an allele of a gene that is expressed when the dominant allele is not
   present. An allele expressed only in homozygous form, when the dominant allele is absent.

   recombinant DNA molecules  New combinations of DNA fragments formed by cutting DNA segments from
   two sources with restriction enzyme and then joining the fragments together with DNA ligase.
   Interspecies transfer of genes usually through a vector such as a virus or plasmid.

   recombinant DNA technology  A series of techniques in which DNA fragments are linked to
   self-replicating forms of DNA to create recombinant DNA molecules. These molecules in turn are
   replicated in a host cell to create clones of the inserted segments.

   recombination  A way in which meiosis produces new combinations of genetic information. During
   synapsis, chromatids may exchange parts with other chromatids, leading to a physical exchange of
   chromosome parts; thus, genes from both parents may be combined on the same chromosome, creating
   a new combination.

   red algae Common name for the algae placed in the division Rhodophyta.

   red blood cell Component of the blood that transports oxygen with the hemoglobin molecule. See
   also erythrocyte

   color. PICTURE

   chemical reaction.

   member of each pair of chromosomes. PICTURE

   of behavior.

   reflex arc Pathway of neurons, effector(s) and sensory receptors that participate in a reflex.

   region of division  The area of cell division in the tip of a plant root. PICTURE

   region of elongation  The area in the tip of a plant root where cells grow by elongating,
   thereby increasing the length of the root. PICTURE

   region of maturation (differentiation)  The area where primary tissues and root hairs develop in
   the tip of a plant root. PICTURE

   relative time Type of geologic time (absolute time being the other) that places events in a
   sequence relative to each other.

   renal tubule  The portion of the nephron where urine is produced. PICTURE

   renin  An enzyme secreted by the kidneys that converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin II.

   replication Process by which DNA is duplicated prior to cell division. PICTURE

   reproductive isolating mechanism  Biological or behavioral characteristics that reduce or
   prevent interbreeding with other populations; e.g., the production of sterile hybrids.
   Establishment of reproductive isolation is considered essential for development of a new
   species.

   reproductive system  One of eleven major body organ systems in animals; is responsible for
   reproduction and thus the survival of the species. PICTURE

   reptiles Taxonomic class of vertebrates characterized by scales and amniotic eggs; the first
   truly terrestrial vertebrate group.

   resolution  In relation to microscopes, the ability to view adjacent objects as distinct
   structures.

   resource partitioning  The division of resources such that a few dominant species exploit most
   of the available resources while other species divide the remainder; helps explain why a few
   species are abundant in a community while others are represented by only a few individuals.

   respiration 1) breathing as part of gas exchange; or 2) cellular metabolism.

   respiratory surface  A thin, moist, epithelial surface that oxygen can cross to move into the
   body and carbon dioxide can cross to move out of the body.

   respiratory system  One of eleven major body organ systems in animals; moves oxygen from the
   external environment into the internal environment and removes carbon dioxide from the body.
   PICTURE

   resting potential  The difference in electrical charge across the plasma membrane of a neuron.

   restriction enzymes  A series of enzymes that attach to DNA molecules at speciÞc nucleotide
   sequences and cut both strands of DNA at those sites. A bacterial enzyme that cuts DNA at a
   specific recognition sequence. This is a bacterial defense against viral DNA and plasmid DNA and
   is now used as an important tool in biotechnology.

   restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)  A heritable difference in DNA fragment length
   and fragment number; passed from generation to generation in a codominant way.

   retina  The inner, light-sensitive layer of the eye; includes the rods and cones.

   retroviruses  Viruses that contain a single strand of RNA as their genetic material and
   reproduce by copying the RNA into a complementary DNA strand using the enzyme reverse
   transcriptase. The single-stranded DNA is then copied, and the resulting double-stranded DNA is
   inserted into a chromosome of the host cell. PICTURE 1 | PICTURE 2 | PICTURE 3 | PICTURE 4

   reverse transcriptase  An enzyme used in the replication of retroviruses; aids in copying the
   retrovirus's RNA into a complementary strand of DNA once inside the host cell. PICTURE 1 |

   reverse transcription Process of transcribing a single-stranded DNA from a single-stranded RNA
   (the reverse of transcription); used by retroviruses as well as in biotechnology.

   of the synovial membrane, followed by bone degeneration and disÞgurement.

   rhizoids  Filamentous structures in the plants group known as bryophytes that attach to a
   substrate and absorb moisture. The term is also applied to similar structures found outside the
   bryophytes.

   rhizome  In ferns, a horizontal stem with upright leaves containing vascular tissue.

   rhodopsin  A visual pigment contained in the rods of the retina in the eye..

   ribonucleic acid (RNA) Nucleic acid containing ribose sugar and the base Uracil; RNA functions
   in protein synthesis. The single starnded molecule transcribed from one strand of the DNA. There
   are three types of RNA, each is involved in protein synthesis. RNA is made up nucleotides
   containing the sugar ribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases (adenine,
   uracil, cytosine or guanine). PICTURE

   ribose Sugar found in nucleotides of RNA and in ATP. PICTURE

   ribosomal RNA One of the three types of RNA; rRNA is a structural component in ribosomes.

   ribosomal subunits Two units that combine with mRNA to form the ribosomal-mRNA complex at which
   protein synthesis occurs.

   ribosomes  Small organelles made of rRNA and protein in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic and
   eukaryotic cells; aid in the production of proteins on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and
   ribosome complexes. The site of protein synthesis. The ribosome is composed of two subunits that
   attach to the mRNA at the beginning of protein synthesis and detach when the polypeptide has
   been translated. PICTURE

   RNA polymerase  During transcription, an enzyme that attaches to the promoter region of the DNA
   template, joins nucleotides to form the synthesized strand of RNA and detaches from the template
   when it reaches the terminator region. PICTURE

   plant. PICTURE
