   Fungi are almost entirely multicellular (with yeast, Saccharomyces cerviseae, being a prominent
   unicellular fungus), heterotrophic (deriving their energy from another organism, whether alive
   or dead), and usually having some cells with two nuclei (multinucleate, as opposed to the more
   common one, or uninucleate, condition) per cell. Ecologically this kingdom is important (along
   with certain bacteria) as decomposers and recyclers of nutrients. Economically, the Fungi
   provide us with food (mushrooms; Bleu cheese/Roquefort cheese; baking and brewing), antibiotics
   (the first of the wonder drugs, penicillin, was isolated from the fungus Penicillium), and crop
   parasites (doing several million dollars per year of damage). Fungi are also important aiders of
   plant root function, as mycorrizhae. Examples of this diverse group are shown in Figure 1.

   The evolution of multicellular eukaryotes increased the size and complexity of organisms,
   allowing them to exploit the terrestrial habitat. Fungi first evolved in water but made the
   transition to land through the development of specialized structures that prevented their drying
   out. First classified as plants, fungi are now considered different enough from plants to be
   placed in a separate kingdom, and in fact are more like animals than plants.

  Body Plans and Nutritional Modes | Back to Top

   Fungi contain unicellular, multinucleate, and multicellular forms.They are classified on the
   basis of their reproductive spores and the nature of their multinucleate or multicellular
   filaments known as hyphae. The structure of Penicillium is shown in Figure 2. Fungal cells have
   cell walls containing the carbohydrate chitin. Chitin also occurs in the exoskeletons of the
   animal phylum arthropoda.

   spores (blue), Penicillium sp. (SEM x1,560). This image is copyright Dennis Kunkel at

   Fungi are absorptive heterotrophs: they break down food by secreting digestive enzymes onto a
   substrate and then absorb the resulting small food molecules. Fungal hyphae have a small volume
   but large surface area, enhancing the fungal absorptive capacity. Excess sugar is stored as the
   polysaccharide glycogen. This is also the storage product for sugars in animals.

   Fungal hyphae are collectively termed a mycelium. Some fungi are saprophytes, they obtain their
   food from the decaying bodies of plants and animals. Other fungi are parasites. All fungi,
   except the chytrids, lack flagella. Fungal reproduction thus mandates that the nonmotile gametes
   be brought together by the meeting of opposite strains of hyphae.

   Fungi are important both as a source of food and in the preparation of food. Edible fungi
   include mushrooms, truffles, and morels. Cheeses such as Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Stilton, and
   bleu have fungal colonies that give theses cheeses their distinctive flavors. Beer and wine are
   produced through the action of fungi known as yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisae. Many
   antibiotics, such as penicillin, are also produced by fungi.

   Fungi also are important crop parasites, causing loss of food plants, spoilage of food and some
   infectious diseases. The 1972 U.S. corn crop was almost completely eradicated by a fungus.
   Fungal parasites annually cause many billions of dollars in crop damage and food spoilage.

  Classification of Fungi | Back to Top

   Over 60,000 species of fungi are known. Fungi are classified by their method of reproduction
   (both sexual and asexual). It seems likely that fungi are not a monophyletic group. Historically
   they have been divided into four taxonomic divisions: Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and
   Deuteromycota. The last group, the Deuteromycota, are not a monophyletic group and thus have no
   standing in a modern classification scheme. The modern systematic grouping includes the
   Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota, as well as the Chytridiomycota.

  Phylum Chytridiomycota | Back to Top

   The Phylum Chytridiomycota include some of the oldest fungal fossils (from the latest
   precambrian of Russia), as well as the presence of flagellated gametes. Flagella are absent in
   the cells of all other fungi. All but one group of this phylum has chitin comprising their cell
   walls. Chytrids are aquatic, not terrestrial as are almost all other fungi. They thus may
   provide us with a glimpse of the earliest fungi, both in habit as well as structure. This
   division also has quite a diverse arrayof body plans and habitats. Allomyces is a chytrid used
   in some experiments.

  Phylum Zygomycota | Back to Top

   The Phylum Zygomycota consists of fewer than 1000 species. The zygomycete hyphae do not have one
   nucleus per cell, but rather have long multinucleate, haploid hyphae that comprise their
   mycelia. Asexual reproduction is by spores produced in stalked sporangia, such as shown in
   Figure 3.

                                             [92748a.jpg]

   Sexual reproduction involved the fusion of haploid mating hyphae to produce a diploid zygospore,
   a process shown in Figure 4.

                                          [zygomyceteSC.gif]

   There are less than 1000 species of zygomycetes. Common bread molds are in this group, as are a
   few species that parasitize plants and animals. Most zygomycetes feed on dead or decaying plant
   and animal material. Expose some bread to air for a few hours and it very likely will become
   infected with spores of a zygomycete.

  Phylum Ascomycota | Back to Top

   The Phylum Ascomycota contains more than 30,000 species ranging in body style from of
   unicellular yeasts to multicellular fungi such as morels. Yeasts reproduce asexually by budding
   and sexually by forming a sac (or ascus). One yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is important for
   genetic research as well as its commercial applications in baking and brewing. Yeasts are part
   of the Human Genome Project and serve as easily studied models for eukaryotic gene systems.
   Yeast chromosomes have also been modified to serve as vectors for transporting human DNA
   fragments for use in gene mapping. Other notable ascomycetes include Morchella esculentum, the
   morel, and Neurospora crassa, the organism used by George Beadle and Edward Tatum to develop the
   "one-gene-one-enzyme" hypothesis. Some ascomycetes also cause disease of can make chemicals
   associated with diseases. In this group are Aspergillus flavus, which produces a contaminant of
   nuts and stored grain that acts both as a toxin and the most deadly known natural carcinogen.
   Candida albicans is another sac fungus that causes diaper rash and vaginal infections. Clearly
   this group, which may include nearly three-fourths of the fungal specis, offers humans both
   blessings as well as curses. Representtaives of this diverse group are shown in Figure 5.

   [03dk21236Av.jpg]

   Sac fungi are also important in decomposing and recycling organic matter. Some ascomycetes are
   parasites responsible for Dutch Elm disease and Chestnut blight. Other sac fungi are used in
   commercial baking and brewing, wine making, and in the production of antibiotics, including some
   species of Penicillium, the fungus that produced penicillin, the first of the wonder drugs.

   The term yeast is widely applied to ususally single-celled ascomycetes such as Candida albicans
   and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (sold as brewer's yeast or baker's yeast). The latter fungus is
   useful to humans as a leavening agent in bread as well as brewing of beer and similar alcoholic
   beverages. These fungi typically are unicellular and reproduce by asexual budding as well as the
   sexual process involving the formation of asci.

   Claviceps purpurea, cause of the crop disease known as wild ergot (or Jack-in-the-Rye), is a
   natural source of the hallucenogen LSD. Some sholars speculate that an outbreak of wild ergot
   may have been responsible for the hallucinations associated with the Great Awakening in 17th
   century America. The parasite causes the production of a long, dark purple spur (hence the
   species name "purpurea") which contains the dormant fungus. During this doimrant phase the
   fungus produces several defense chemicals known as alkaloids, as well as lysegric acid and
   related compounds. These latter compounds can cause the reported psychotrophic effects.

   The deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico (as well as areas in South
   America) are home top an endemic fungus, Coccidioides immitis, which causes a disease in humans
   and animals known as valley fever. The disease, formally known as coccidioidomycosis, usually
   begins as a respiratory infection. In the most severe cases death results, although most
   sufferers survive and are thought relatively immune for the remainder of their lives. If
   diagnosed properly there are medical treatments available. Rumors of the use of this organism as
   a bioweapon are thought to be just rumors, due to the extreme care needed to grow and work with
   this organism, whose infectious spores are approximately the size of large bacteria. Those at
   higher risk from Coccidioides include those with compromised immune systems (AIDS patients,
   transplant recipients, diabetics), certain ethnicities, and those whose work exposes them to
   desert soils at certain times of the year. This fungus, whose sexual stage is unknown at
   present, is of uncertain taxonomic placement: some structures look like zygomycetes, but the
   ribosomal RNA data suggests this fungus is an ascomycete.

   Some ascomycetes are (along with basiodiomycetes) the symbiotic mycorrhizae fungi that are
   important to plant root function. Plants with mycorrhizae grow better: the plant gets nutrients
   from the fungus in exchange for carbohydrates.

  Phylum Basidiomycota| Back to Top

   Mushrooms, toadstools, and puffballs are commonly encountered basidiomycetes. These conspicuous
   features of the fungi are the reproductive structures known as fruiting bodies (although they do
   NOT produce fruit, but rather, characteristic basidiospores). Sexual reproduction involves the
   formation of basidiospores on club-shaped cells known as basidia, as shown in Figure 6.

   Figure 6. Fruiting structure of a mushroom. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of
   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                           [basidioLC.gif]

   Club fungi are important as commercial crops. They also cause many diseases that result in loss
   or reduction of grain yields. Agaricus bisporis is the common mushroom found in grocery stores
   as the white button mushroom, crimini mushroom, and the fabulous portabella mushroom. Lentinus
   edodes is the less commonly bought shitake mushroom (in my hobbitsh mushroom loving mid a tasty
   addition to food! [see J.R.R. Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring for an account of hobbit mushroom
   greed]). More than $14 billion per year of these products are sold worldwide.

   http://www.cliphoto.com.

                                       [agaricus_bisporus2.jpg]

   [agaricus.jpg]

   Amanita is a fungal genus that cointains some of the most poisionous of all mushrooms. Amanita
   bisporigera, Amanita virosa, and Amanita verna are collectively referred to as the death angel.
   These fungi produce a small protein that affects the liver and kidney functions, producing death
   within five days unless transplantation can happen to replace the damaged organs. Amanita
   phalloides, shown in Figure 8, is also a deadly fungus. Not all species of this genus are
   deadly. Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric, will make you sick and have hallucinations if you are
   stupid enough to eat it (although this species has been associated with religious ceremonies,
   and possibly Viking ferocity in battle, in many parts of the Old World).

                                      [Amanita_phalloides.JPEG]

   Other mushrooms also have hallucinogenic properties (such as the drug psilocybin, found in the
   basidiomycete Psilocybe). Often these mushrooms are important in native religious rituals in
   Central and South America as well as (possibly) other parts of the world. .

   Rusts and smuts are significant crop parasites: corn smut almost destroyed the entire US corn
   crop in the 1970s. During the late 1990s wheat fields in Arizona (yes, we did grow wheat in the
   desert before all of the urban sprawl) had to be destroyed due to the presence of karnal bunt
   fungus. Billions of dollars of food crops worldwide are annually destroyed by these
   basidiomycetes.

  Lichens and Mycorrhizae | Back to Top

   Lichens are a symbiosis between a photosynthetic organism (an alga or cyanobacterium) and a
   fungus (either an ascomycete or a basidiomycete). Lichen often live in marginal environments and
   often grow only one or two centimeters per year. Historically this symbiosis has been considered
   an example of mutualism, where both organisms benefit and neither is harmed by their
   association. Organization of a typical lichen is shown in Figure 9.

   Figure 9. Top: Structure of a lichen, image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology,
   4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used
   with permission; Middle: Pseudoparmelia caperata, a lichen, image from
   http://images.botany.org/set-06/06-001v.jpg; Bottom: Scanning electron micrograph of Trebouxia
   erici w/alagal hyphae, image from http://images.botany.org/set-06/06-016v.jpg.

   [06-001v.jpg]

   [06-016v.jpg]

   Lichens have long been recognized as useful organisms for humans. Certain species of lichen are
   now recognized as indicators of environmental pollution, other types of lichens have been used
   to make natural dyes by indigenous poeople, or even to make poison-tipped arrowheads. Because
   they often live in marginal habitats, lichens have had to develop chemical defenses, making them
   prime targets for natural antibiotic research. One estimate places half of lichen species as
   possessing some sort of antibiotic chemicals. Soe lichen are even edible, although many others
   are harmful if eaten, so extreme caution should be used if investigating edible fungi.

   Mycorrhizae are fungi (usually a zygomycete or basidiomycete) symbiotic with the roots of
   plants. Both relationships are mutualistic: both parties benefit. Fungi provide nutrients from
   the substrate, the phototroph provides food. Plants with mycorrhizae grow better: the plant gets
   nutrients from the fungus in exchange for carbohydrates.
