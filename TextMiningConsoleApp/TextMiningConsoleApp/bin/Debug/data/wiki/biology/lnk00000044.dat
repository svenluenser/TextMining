  Monocots and Dicots | Back to Top

   Angiosperms, flowering plants, are divided into two groups: monocots and dicots.

                                           [monocots_1.gif]

   Monocot seeds have one "seed leaf" termed a cotyledon (in fact monocot is a shortening of
   monocotyledon). Dicots have two cotyledons. Both groups, however, have the same basic
   architecture of nodes, internodes, etc.

   the ringed array of vascular bundles in this dicot stem (Medicago).

   Monocot stems have scattered vascular bundles. Dicot stems have their vascular bundles in a ring
   arrangement. Monocot stems have most of their vascular bundles near the outside edge of the
   stem. The bundles are surrounded by large parenchyma in the cortex region. There is no pith
   region in monocots. Dicot stems have bundles in a ring surrounding parenchyma cells in a pith
   region. Between the bundles and the epidermis are smaller (as compared to the pith) parenchyma
   cells making up the cortex region. Click here to view a large image of plant stem and root
   structure (image is from

   ges/Bean_whole_anatomy).

   Monocot roots, interestingly, have their vascular bundles arranged in a ring. Dicot roots have
   their xylem in the center of the root and phloem outside the xylem. A carrot is an example of a
   dicot root.

   Monocot leaves have their leaf veins arranged parallel to each other and the long axis of the
   leaf (parallel vennation). An common example of this is the husk of corn or a blade of grass
   (both are monocots). Dicot leaves have an anastamosing network of veins arising from a mid-vein
   termed net vennation. Examples of dicot leaves include maples, oaks, geraniums, and dandelions.

   Monocots have their flower parts in threes or multiples of three; example the tulip and lily
   (Lilium ). Dicots have their flower parts in fours (or multiples) or fives (or multiples).
   Examples of some common dicot flowers include the geranium, snapdragon, and citrus.

  Secondary Growth | Back to Top

   Secondary growth is produced by a cambium. It occurs in rows or ranks of cork, secondary xylem
   or secondary phloem cells. Cork cells (produced by a cork cambium) are technically part of the
   epidermis, and contribute to the bark of woody stems.

   Dicot secondary growth occurs by growth of vascular cambium, to complete a full vascular
   cylinder around the plant. Secondary xylem is produced to the inside of the vascular cambium,
   secondary phloem to the outside. The living parts of the woody plant are next to the vascular
   cambium.

   At the end of each growing season, the vascular cambium stops growing, forming a growth ring.

   Monocots usually don't have secondary growth. Some, such as bamboo and palm trees, have
   secondary growth. Monocot secondary growth differs from dicot secondary growth in that new
   bundles are formed at the edge of the stem. These new bundles are close together, providing
   support for the stem.

  The Leaf | Back to Top

   The leaf consists of the (generally) flat blade, one or more leaf veins, a petiole, and usually
   an axillary bud. The petiole can be long (as in celery and bok-choy) or short (as in cabbage and
   lettuce). Leaves may be simple or compound: simple leaves have a single subdivision or leaflet,
   compound leaves have more than one leaflet. Leaves attach to stems at nodes (internodes are the
   spaces between nodes). Leaf phyllotaxy is the pattern exhibited (spiral, opposite, alternate,
   whorled) of leaf attachment to a stem.
