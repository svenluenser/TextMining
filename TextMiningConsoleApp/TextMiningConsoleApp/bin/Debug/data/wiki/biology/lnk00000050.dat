  Integumentary System | Back to Top

   The skin is the largest organ in the body: 12-15% of body weight, with a surface area of 1-2
   meters. Skin is continuous with, but structurally distinct from mucous membranes that line the
   mouth, anus, urethra, and vagina. Two distinct layers occur in the skin: the dermis and
   epidermis. The basic cell type of the epidermis is the keratinocyte, which contain keratin, a
   fibrous protein. Basal cells are the innermost layer of the epidermis. Melanocytes produce the
   pigment melanin, and are also in the inner layer of the epidermis. The dermis is a connective
   tissue layer under the epidermis, and contains nerve endings, sensory receptors, capillaries,
   and elastic fibers.

   The integumentary system has multiple roles in homeostasis, including protection, temperature
   regulation, sensory reception, biochemical synthesis, and absorption. All body systems work in
   an interconnected manner to maintain the internal conditions essential to the function of the
   body.

  Follicles and Glands | Back to Top

   Hair follicles are lined with cells that synthesize the proteins that form hair. A sebaceous
   gland (that secretes the oily coating of the hair shaft), capillary bed, nerve ending, and small
   muscle are associated with each hair follicle. If the sebaceous glands becomes plugged and
   infected, it becomes a skin blemish (or pimple). The sweat glands open to the surface through
   the skin pores. Eccrine glands are a type of sweat gland linked to the sympathetic nervous
   system; they occur all over the body. Apocrine glands are the other type of sweat gland, and are
   larger and occur in the armpits and groin areas; these produce a solution that bacteria act upon
   to produce "body odor".

  Hair and Nails | Back to Top

   Hair, scales, feathers, claws, horns, and nails are animal structures derived from skin. The
   hair shaft extends above the skin surface, the hair root extends from the surface to the base or
   hair bulb. Genetics controls several features of hair: baldness, color, texture.

   Nails consist of highly keratinized, modified epidermal cells. The nail arises from the nail
   bed, which is thickened to form a lunula (or little moon). Cells forming the nail bed are linked
   together to form the nail.

  Skin and Homeostasis | Back to Top

   Skin functions in homeostasis include protection, regulation of body temperature, sensory
   reception, water balance, synthesis of vitamins and hormones, and absorption of materials. The
   skin's primary functions are to serve as a barrier to the entry of microbes and viruses, and to
   prevent water and extracellular fluid loss. Acidic secretions from skin glands also retard the
   growth of fungi. Melanocytes form a second barrier: protection from the damaging effects of
   ultraviolet radiation. When a microbe penetrates the skin (or when the skin is breached by a
   cut) the inflammatory response occurs.

   Heat and cold receptors are located in the skin. When the body temperature rises, the
   hypothalamus sends a nerve signal to the sweat-producing skin glands, causing them to release
   about 1-2 liters of water per hour, cooling the body. The hypothalamus also causes dilation of
   the blood vessels of the skin, allowing more blood to flow into those areas, causing heat to be
   convected away from the skin surface. When body temperature falls, the sweat glands constrict
   and sweat production decreases. If the body temperature continues to fall, the body will engage
   in thermiogenesis, or heat generation, by raising the body's metabolic rate and by shivering.

   Water loss occurs in the skin by two routes.
    1. evaporation
    2. sweating

   In hot weather up to 4 liters per hour can be lost by these mechanisms. Skin damaged by burns is
   less effective at preventing fluid loss, often resulting in a possibly life threatening problem
   if not treated.

  Skin and Sensory Reception | Back to Top

   Sensory receptors in the skin include those for pain, pressure (touch), and temperature. Deeper
   within the skin are Meissner's corpuscles, which are especially common in the tips of the
   fingers and lips, and are very sensitive to touch. Pacinian corpuscles respond to pressure.
   Temperature receptors: more cold ones than hot ones.

  Skin and Synthesis | Back to Top

   Skin cells synthesize melanin and carotenes, which give the skin its color. The skin also
   assists in the synthesis of vitamin D. Children lacking sufficient vitamin D develop bone
   abnormalities known as rickets.

  Skin Is Selectively Permeable | Back to Top

   The skin is selectively soluble to fat-soluble substances such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, as
   well as steroid hormones such as estrogen. These substances enter the bloodstream through the
   capillary networks in the skin. Patches have been used to deliver a number of therapeutic drugs
   in this manner. These include estrogen, scopolamine (motion sickness), nitroglycerin (heart
   problems), and nicotine (for those trying to quit smoking).
