Atoms | Back to Top

   Most of the Universe consists of matter and energy. Energy is the capacity to do work. Matter
   has mass and occupies space. All matter is composed of basic elements that cannot be broken down
   to substances with different chemical or physical properties. Elements are substances consisting
   of one type of atom, for example Carbon atoms make up diamond, and also graphite. Pure (24K)
   gold is composed of only one type of atom, gold atoms. Atoms are the smallest particle into
   which an element can be divided. The ancient Greek philosophers developed the concept of the
   atom, although they considered it the fundamental particle that could not be broken down. Since
   the work of Enrico Fermi and his colleagues, we now know that the atom is divisible, often
   releasing tremendous energies as in nuclear explosions or (in a controlled fashion in)
   thermonuclear power plants.

   Subatomic particles were discovered during the 1800s. For our purposes we will concentrate only
   on three of them, summarized in Table 1. The proton is located in the center (or nucleus) of an
   atom, each atom has at least one proton. Protons have a charge of +1, and a mass of
   approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu). Elements differ from each other in the number of protons
   they have, e.g. Hydrogen has 1 proton; Helium has 2.

   The neutron also is located in the atomic nucleus (except in Hydrogen). The neutron has no
   charge, and a mass of slightly over 1 amu. Some scientists propose the neutron is made up of a
   proton and electron-like particle.

   The electron is a very small particle located outside the nucleus. Because they move at speeds
   near the speed of light the precise location of electrons is hard to pin down. Electrons occupy
   orbitals, or areas where they have a high statistical probability of occurring. The charge on an
   electron is -1. Its mass is negligible (approximately 1800 electrons are needed to equal the
   mass of one proton).

   The atomic number is the number of protons an atom has. It is characteristic and unique for each
   element. The atomic mass (also referred to as the atomic weight) is the number of protons and
   neutrons in an atom. Atoms of an element that have differing numbers of neutrons (but a constant
   atomic number) are termed isotopes. Isotopes, shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, can be used to
   determine the diet of ancient peoples by determining proportions of isotopes in mummified or
   fossilized human tissues. Biochemical pathways can be deciphered by using isotopic tracers. The
   age of fossils and artifacts can be determined by using radioactive isotopes, either directly on
   the fossil (if it is young enough) or on the rocks that surround the fossil (for older fossils
   like dinosaurs). Isotopes are also the source of radiation used in medical diagnostic and
   treatment procedures.

   Figure 1. Note that each of these isotopes of hydrogen has only one proton. Isotopes differ from
   each other in the number of neutrons, not in the number of protons. Image from Purves et al.,

   Some isotopes are radioisotopes, which spontaneously decay, releasing radioactivity. Other
   isotopes are stable. Examples of radioisotopes are Carbon-14 (symbol ^14C), and deuterium (also
   known as Hydrogen-2; ^2H). Stable isotopes are ^12C and ^1H.

   Figure 2. Carbon has three isotopes, of which carbon-12 and carbon-14 are the most well known.

   The Periodic Table of the Elements, a version of which is shown in Figure 3, provides a great
   deal of information about various elements. An on-line Periodic Table is available by clicking
   here,

   Figure 3. The Periodic Table of the Elements. Each Roman numeraled column on the label (at least
   the ones ending in A) tells us how many electrons are in the outer shell of the atom. Each
   numbered row on the table tells us how many electron shells an atom has. Thus, Hydrogen, in
   column IA, row 1 has one electron in one shell. Phosphorous in column VA, row 3 has 5 electrons
   in its outer shell, and has three shells in total. Image from James K. Hardy's chemistry site at
   the University of Akron.

Electrons and energy | Back to Top

   Electrons, because they move so fast (approximately at the speed of light), seem to straddle the
   fence separating energy from matter. Albert Einstein developed his famous E=mc^2 equation
   relating matter and energy over a century ago. Because of his (and others) work, we think of
   electrons both as particles of matter (having mass is a property of matter) and as units (or
   quanta) of energy. When subjected to energy, electrons will acquire some of that energy, as
   shown in Figure 4.

   Figure 4. Excitation of an electron by energy, causing the electron to "jump" to another
   electron (energy) level known as the excited state. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science
   of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                           [excitation.gif]

   An orbital is also an area of space in which an electron will be found 90% of the time. Orbitals
   have a variety of shapes. Each orbital has a characteristic energy state and a characteristic
   shape. The s orbital is spherical. Since each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons,
   atomic numbers above 2 must fill the other orbitals. The p[x], p[y], and p[z] orbitals are
   dumbbell shaped, along the x, y, and z axes respectively. These orbital shapes are shown in
   Figure 5.

   Energy levels (also referred to as electron shells) are located a certain "distance" from the
   nucleus. The major energy levels into which electrons fit, are (from the nucleus outward) K, L,
   M, and N. Sometimes these are numbered, with electron configurations being: 1s^22s^22p^1, (where
   the first shell K is indicated with the number 1, the second shell L with the number 2, etc.).
   This nomenclature tells us that for the atom mentioned in this paragraph, the first energy level
   (shell) has two electrons in its s orbital (the only orbital it can have), and second energy
   level has a maximum of two electrons in its s orbital, plus one electron in its p orbital.

   Figure 5. Geometry of orbitals. S-orbitals are spherical, p-orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell
   or figure 8. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer
   Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

Chemical Bonding | Back to Top

   During the nineteenth century, chemists arranged the then-known elements according to chemical
   bonding, recognizing that one group (the furthermost right column on the Periodic Table,
   referred to as the Inert Gases or Noble Gases) tended to occur in elemental form (in other
   words, not in a molecule with other elements). It was later determined that this group had outer
   electron shells containing two (as in the case of Helium) or eight (Neon, Xenon, Radon, Krypton,
   etc.) electrons.

   As a general rule, for the atoms we are likely to encounter in biological systems, atoms tend to
   gain or lose their outer electrons to achieve a Noble Gas outer electron shell configuration of
   two or eight electrons. The number of electrons that are gained or lost is characteristic for
   each element, and ultimately determines the number and types of chemical bonds atoms of that
   element can form. Atomic diagrams for several atoms are shown in Figure 6.

   Figure 6. Atomic diagrams illustrating the filling of the outer electron shells. Images from
   Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates
   (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   [electronshells_2.gif]

   Ionic bonds are formed when atoms become ions by gaining or losing electrons. Chlorine is in a
   group of elements having seven electrons in their outer shells (see Figure 6). Members of this
   group tend to gain one electron, acquiring a charge of -1. Sodium is in another group with
   elements having one electron in their outer shells. Members of this group tend to lose that
   outer electron, acquiring a charge of +1. Oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other,
   thus Cl^- (the symbolic representation of the chloride ion) and Na^+ (the symbol for the sodium
   ion, using the Greek word natrium) form an ionic bond, becoming the molecule sodium chloride,
   shown in Figure 7. Ionic bonds generally form between elements in Group I (having one electron
   in their outer shell) and Group VIIa (having seven electrons in their outer shell). Such bonds
   are relatively weak, and tend to disassociate in water, producing solutions that have both Na
   and Cl ions.

   Figure 7. TOP: Formation of a crystal of sodium chloride. Each positively charged sodium ion is
   surropunded by six negatively charged chloride ions; likewise each negatively charged chloride
   ion is surrounded by six positively charged sodium ions. The overall effect is electrical
   neutrality. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer

   Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons. Since electrons move very fast they can be
   shared, effectively filling or emptying the outer shells of the atoms involved in the bond. Such
   bonds are referred to as electron-sharing bonds. An analogy can be made to child custody: the
   children are like electrons, and tend to spend some time with one parent and the rest of their
   time with the other parent. In a covalent bond, the electron clouds surrounding the atomic
   nuclei overlap, as shown in Figure 8.

   Figure 8. Formation of a covalent bond between two Hydrogen atoims. Image from Purves et al.,
   Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH
   Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                           [hydrogencv.gif]

   Carbon (C) is in Group IVa, meaning it has four electrons in its outer shell. Thus to become a
   "happy atom", Carbon can either gain or lose four electrons. By sharing the electrons with other
   atoms, Carbon can become a happy atom,. alternately filling and emptying its outer shell, as
   with the four hydrogens shown in Figure 9.

   Figure 9. Formation of covalent bonds in methane. Carbon needs to share four electrons, in
   effect it has four slots. Each hydrogen provides an electron to each of these slots. At the same
   time each hydrogen needs to fill one slot, which is done by sharing an electron with the carbon.

   (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                    [methane-1.gif] [methane2.gif]

   The molecule methane (chemical formula CH[4]) has four covalent bonds, one between Carbon and
   each of the four Hydrogens. Carbon contributes an electron, and Hydrogen contributes an
   electron. The sharing of a single electron pair is termed a single bond. When two pairs of
   electrons are shared, a double bond results, as in carbon dioxide. Triple bonds are known,
   wherein three pairs (six electrons total) are shared as in acetylene gas or nitrogen gas. The
   types of covalent bonds are shown in Figure 10.

   Figure 10. Ways of representing covalent bonds. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of
   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                           [sdtcovbon.gif]

   Sometimes electrons tend to spend more time with one atom in the bond than with the other. In
   such cases a polar covalent bond develops. Water (H[2]O) is an example. Since the electrons
   spend so much time with the oxygen (oxygen having a greater electronegativity, or electron
   affinity) that end of the molecule acquires a slightly negative charge. Conversely, the loss of
   the electrons from the hydrogen end leaves a slightly positive charge. The water molecule is
   thus polar, having positive and negative sides.

   Hydrogen bonds, as shown in Figure 11, result from the weak electrical attraction between the
   positive end of one molecule and the negative end of another. Individually these bonds are very
   weak, although taken in a large enough quantity, the result is strong enough to hold molecules
   together or in a three-dimensional shape.

   Figure 11. TOP: Formation of a hydrogen bond between the hydrogen side of one water molecule and
   the oxygen side of another water molecule. BOTTOM: The presence of polar areas in the amino
   acids that makeup a protein allows for hydrogen bonds to form, giving the molecule a
   three-dimensional shape that is often vital to that protein's proper functioning. Images from

Chemical reactions and molecules | Back to Top

   Molecules are compounds in which the elements are in definite, fixed ratios, as seen in Figure
   12. Those atoms are held together usually by one of the three types of chemical bonds discussed
   above. For example: water, glucose, ATP. Mixtures are compounds with variable formulas/ratios of
   their components. For example: soil. Molecular formulas are an expression in the simplest
   whole-number terms of the composition of a substance. For example, the sugar glucose has 6
   Carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 6 oxygens per repeating structural unit. The formula is written
   C[6]H[12]O[6].

   Chemical reactions occur in nature, and some also can be performed in a laboratory setting. One
   such reaction is diagrammed in Figure 13. Chemical equations are linear representations of how
   these reactions occur. Combination reactions occur when two separate reactants are bonded
   together, e.g. A + B -----> AB. Disassociation reactions occur when a compound is broken into
   two products, e.g. AB -----> A + B.

   carbon dioxide, water, and energy (as heat and light). This chemical reaction takes place in a

   Biological systems, while unique to each species, are based on the chemical bonding properties
   of carbon. Major organic chemicals (those associated with or formed by the actions of living
   things) usually include some ratios of the following elements: C, H, N, O, P, S.
