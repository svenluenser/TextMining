  The Lymphatic System | Back to Top

   The lymphatic system is composed of lymph vessels, lymph nodes, and organs. The functions of
   this system include the absorbtion of excess fluid and its return to the blood stream,
   absorption of fat (in the villi of the small intestine) and the immune system function.

   Lymph vessels are closely associated with the circulatory system vessels. Larger lymph vessels
   are similar to veins. Lymph capillaries are scatted throughout the body. Contraction of skeletal
   muscle causes movement of the lymph fluid through valves.

   Lymph organs include the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus. Bone marrow contains
   tissue that produces lymphocytes. B-lymphocytes (B-cells) mature in the bone marrow.
   T-lymphocytes (T-cells) mature in the thymus gland. Other blood cells such as monocytes and
   leukocytes are produced in the bone marrow. Lymph nodes are areas of concentrated lymphocytes
   and macrophages along the lymphatic veins. The spleen is similar to the lymph node except that
   it is larger and filled with blood. The spleen serves as a reservoir for blood, and filters or
   purifies the blood and lymph fluid that flows through it. If the spleen is damaged or removed,
   the individual is more susceptible to infections. The thymus secretes a hormone, thymosin, that
   causes pre-T-cells to mature (in the thymus) into T-cells.

  Immunity | Back to Top

   Immunity is the body's capability to repel foreign substances and cells. The nonspecific
   responses are the first line of defense. Highly specific responses are the second line of
   defense and are tailored to an individual threat. The immune response includes both specific and
   nonspecific components. Nonspecific responses block the entry and spread of disease-causing
   agents. Antibody-mediated and cell-mediated responses are two types of specific response. The
   immune system is associated with defense against disease-causing agents, problems in transplants
   and blood transfusions, and diseases resulting from over-reaction (autoimmune, allergies) and
   under-reaction (AIDS).

  General Defenses | Back to Top

   Barriers to entry are the skin and mucous membranes. The skin is a passive barrier to infectious
   agents such as bacteria and viruses. The organisms living on the skin surface are unable to
   penetrate the layers of dead skin at the surface. Tears and saliva secrete enzymes that
   breakdown bacterial cell walls. Skin glands secrete chemicals that retard the growth of
   bacteria. Mucus membranes lining the respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts
   secrete mucus that forms another barrier. Physical barriers are the first line of defense.

   When microorganisms penetrate skin or epithelium lining respiratory, digestive, or urinary
   tracts, inflammation results. Damaged cells release chemical signals such as histamine that
   increase capillary blood flow into the affected area (causing the areas to become heated and
   reddened). The heat makes the environment unfavorable for microbes, promotes healing, raises
   mobility of white blood cells, and increases the metabolic rate of nearby cells. Capillaries
   pass fluid into interstitial areas, causing the infected/injured area to swell. Clotting factors
   trigger formation of many small blood clots. Finally, monocytes (a type of white blood cell)
   clean up dead microbes, cells, and debris.

   The inflammatory response is often strong enough to stop the spread of disease-causing agents
   such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The response begins with the release of chemical signals
   and ends with cleanup by monocytes. If this is not enough to stop the invaders, the complement
   system and immune response act.

   Protective proteins that are produced in the liver include the complement system of proteins.
   The complement system proteins bind to a bacterium and open pores in its membrane through which
   fluids and salt move, swelling and bursting the cell.

   The complement system directly kills microbes, supplements inflammatory response, and works with
   the immune response. It complements the actions of the immune system. Complement proteins are
   made in the liver and become active in a sequence (C1 activates C2, etc.). The final five
   proteins form a membrane-attack complex (MAC) that embeds itself into the plasma membrane of the
   attacker. Salts enter the invader, facilitating water to cross the membrane, swelling and
   bursting the microbe. Complement also functions in the immune response by tagging the outer
   surface of invaders for attack by phagocytes.

   Interferon is a species-specific chemical produced by cells that are viral attack. It alerts
   nearby cells to prepare for a virus. The cells that have been contacted by interferon resist all
   viral attacks.

  Specific Defenses | Back to Top

   The immune system also generates specific responses to specific invaders.

   The immune system is more effective than the nonspecific methods, and has a memory component
   that improves response time when an invader of the same type (or species) is again encountered.

   Immunity results from the production of antibodies specific to a given antigen
   (antibody-generators, located on the surface of an invader). Antibodies bind to the antigens on
   invaders and kill or inactivate them in several ways. Most antibodies are themselves proteins or
   are a mix of protein and polysaccharides. Antigens can be any molecule that causes antibody
   production.

    Lymphocytes

   White blood cells known as lymphocytes arise from by mitosis of stem cells in the bone marrow.
   Some lymphocytes migrate to the thymus and become T cells that circulate in the blood and are
   associated with the lymph nodes and spleen. B cells remain in the bone marrow and develop before
   moving into the circulatory and lymph systems. B cells produce antibodies.

    Antibody-mediated (humoral immunity)

   Antibody-mediated (humoral) immunity is regulated by B cells and the antibodies they produce.
   Cell-mediated immunity is controlled by T cells. Antibody-mediated reactions defend against
   invading viruses and bacteria. Cell-mediated immunity concerns cells in the body that have been
   infected by viruses and bacteria, protect against parasites, fungi, and protozoans, and also
   kill cancerous body cells.

  Antibody-mediated Immunity | Back to Top

   Stages in this process are:
    1. antigen detection
    2. activation of helper T cells
    3. antibody production by B cells

   Each stage is directed by a specific cell type.

    Macrophages

   Macrophages are white blood cells that continually search for foreign (nonself) antigenic
   molecules, viruses, or microbes. When found, the macrophages engulfs and destroys them. Small
   fragments of the antigen are displayed on the outer surface of the macrophage plasma membrane.

    Helper T Cells

   Helper T cells are macrophages that become activated when they encounter the antigens now
   displayed on the macrophage surface. Activated T cells identify and activate B cells.

    B Cells

   B cells divide, forming plasma cells and B memory cells. Plasma cells make and release between
   2000 and 20,000 antibody molecules per second into the blood for the next four or five days. B
   memory cells live for months or years, and are part of the immune memory system.

    Antibodies

   Antibodies bind to specific antigens in a lock-and-key fashion, forming an antigen-antibody
   complex. Antibodies are a type of protein molecule known as immunoglobulins. There are five
   classes of immunoglobulins: IgG, IgA, IgD, IgE, and IgM.

   Antibodies are Y-shaped molecules composed of two identical long polypeptide (Heavy or H chains)
   and two identical short polypeptides (Light or L chains). Function of antibodies includes:
    1. Recognition and binding to antigens
    2. Inactivation of the antigen

   A unique antigenic determinant recognizes and binds to a site on the antigen, leading to the
   destruction of the antigen in several ways. The ends of the Y are the antigen-combining site
   that is different for each antigen. Click here to learn more about the different classes of
   antibodies.

   Helper T cells activate B cells that produce antibodies. Supressor T cells slow down and stop
   the immune response of B and T cells, serving as an off switch for the immune system. Cytotoxic
   (or killer) T cells destroy body cells infected with a virus or bacteria. Memory T cells remain
   in the body awaiting the reintroduction of the antigen.

   A cell infected with a virus will display viral antigens on its plasma membrane. Killer T cells
   recognize the viral antigens and attach to that cell's plasma membrane. The T cells secrete
   proteins that punch holes in the infected cell's plasma membrane. The infected cell's cytoplasm
   leaks out, the cell dies, and is removed by phagocytes. Killer T cells may also bind to cells of
   transplanted organs.

   The immune system is the major component of this defense. Lymphocytes, monocytes, lymph organs,
   and lymph vessels make up the system. The immune system is able to distinguish self from
   non-self. Antigens are chemicals on the surface of a cell. All cells have these. The immune
   system checks cells and identifies them as "self" or "non-self". Antibodies are proteins
   produced by certain lymphocytes in response to a specific antigen. B-lymphocytes and
   T-lymphocytes produce the antibodies. B-lymphocytes become plasma cells which then generate
   antibodies. T-lymphocytes attack cells which bear antigens they recognize. They also mediate the
   immune response.

    The immune system and memory of infections

   Secondary immunity, the resistance to certain diseases after having had them once, results from
   production of Memory B and T cells during the first exposure to the antigen. A second exposure
   to the same antigen produces a more massive and faster response. The secondary response is the
   basis for vaccination.

    Vaccination

   Vaccination is a term derived from the Latin vacca (cow, after the cowpox material used by
   Edward Jenner in the first vaccination). A vaccine stimulates the antibody production and
   formation of memory cells without causing of the disease. Vaccines are made from killed
   pathogens or weakened strains that cause antibody production but not the disease. Recombinant
   DNA techniques can now be used to develop even safer vaccines.

   The immune system can develop long-term immunity to some diseases. Man can use this to develop
   vaccines, which produce induced immunity. Active immunity develops after an illness or vaccine.
   Vaccines are weakened (or killed) viruses or bacteria that prompt the development of antibodies.
   Application of biotechnology allows development of vaccines that are the protein (antigen) which
   in no way can cause the disease. Passive immunity is the type of immunity when the individual is
   given antibodies to combat a specific disease. Passive immunity is short-lived.

  Blood Types, Rh, and Antibodies | Back to Top

   There are 30 or more known antigens on the surface of blood cells. These form the blood groups
   or blood types. In a transfusion, the blood groups of the recipient and donor must be matched.
   If improperly matched, the recipient's immune system will produce antibodies causing clotting of
   the transfused cells, blocking circulation through capillaries and producing serious or even
   fatal results.

   ABO blood types are determined by a gene, I (for isoagglutinin). There are three alleles, I^A,
   I^B and I^O. Proteins produced by the A and B alleles are antigenic. Individuals with blood type
   A have the A antigen on the surface of their red blood cells, and antibodies to type B blood in
   their plasma. People with blood type B have the B antigen on their blood cells and antibodies
   against type A in their plasma. Individuals with type AB blood produce have antigens for A and B
   on their cell surfaces and no antibodies for either blood type A or B in their plasma. Type O
   individuals have no antigens on their red blood cells but antigens to both A and B are in their
   plasma.

   People with type AB blood can receive blood of any type. Those with type O blood can donate to
   anyone. If a transfusion is made between an incompatible donor and recipient, the recipient's
   blood will undergo a cascade of events. Reaction of antigens on cells and antibodies in plasma
   will produce clumping that clogs capillaries, other cells burst, releasing hemoglobin that can
   crystallize in the kidney and lead to kidney failure.

   The Rh (for the rhesus monkey in which it was discovered) blood group is made up of those Rh
   positive (Rh^+) individuals who can make the Rh antigen and those Rh negative (Rh^-) who cannot.

   Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) results from Rh incompatibility between an Rh^- mother
   and Rh^+ fetus. Rh^+ blood from the fetus enters the mother's system during birth, causing her
   to produce Rh antibodies. The first child is usually not affected, however subsequent Rh^+
   fetuses will cause a massive secondary reaction of the maternal immune system. To prevent HDN,
   Rh- mothers are given an Rh antibody during the first pregnancy with an Rh+ fetus and all
   subsequent Rh+ fetuses.

  Organ Transplants and Antibodies | Back to Top

   Success of organ transplants and skin grafts requires a matching of histocompatibility antigens
   that occur on all cells in the body. Chromosome 6 contains a cluster of genes known as the human
   leukocyte antigen complex (HLA) that are critical to the outcome of such procedures. The array
   of HLA alleles on either copy of our chromosome 6 is known as a haplotype.

   The large number of alleles involved mean no two individuals, even in a family, will have the
   same identical haplotype. Identical twins have a 100% HLA match. The best matches are going to
   occur within a family. The preference order for transplants is identical twin > sibling > parent
   > unrelated donor. Chances of an unrelated donor matching the recipient range between 1 in
   100,000-200,000. Matches across racial or ethnic lines are often more difficult. When HLA types
   are matched survival of transplanted organs dramatically increases.

  Allergies and Disorders of the Immune System | Back to Top

   The immune system can overreact, causing allergies or autoimmune diseases. Likewise, a
   suppressed, absent, or destroyed immune system can also result in disease and death.

   Allergies result from immune system hypersensitivity to weak antigens that do not cause an
   immune response in most people. Allergens, substances that cause allergies, include dust, molds,
   pollen, cat dander, certain foods, and some medicines (such as penicillin). Up to 10% of the US
   population suffer from at least one allergy.

   After exposure to an allergen, some people make IgE antibodies as well as B and T memory cells.
   Subsequent exposure to the same allergen causes a massive secondary immune response that
   releases plenty of IgE antibodies. These bind to mast cells found usually in connective tissues
   surrounding blood vessels. Mast cells then release histamine, which starts the inflammatory
   response. In some individuals the histamine release causes life-threatening anaphylaxis or
   anaphylactic shock.

   The immune system usually distinguishes "self" from "nonself". The immune system learns the
   difference between cells of the body and foreign invaders. Autoimmune diseases result when the
   immune system attacks and destroys cells and tissues of the body. Juvenile diabetes, Grave's
   disease, Multiple sclerosis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, and Rheumatoid arthritis are some of
   the autoimmune diseases.

   Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a muscle weakness caused by destruction of muscle-nerve connections.
   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by antibodies attacking the myelin of nerve cells. Systemic
   lupus erythematosis (SLE) has the person forming a series of antibodies to their own tissues,
   such as kidneys (the leading cause of death in SLE patients) and the DNA in their own cellular
   nuclei. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the immune system attacks connective tissues and
   major organs of the body. Rheumatoid Arthritis; sufferers have damage to their joints. Some
   evidence supports Type I diabetes as an auto immune disease. Juvenile diabetes results from the
   destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

   Immunodeficiency diseases result from the lack or failure of one or more parts of the immune
   system. Affected individuals are susceptible to diseases that normally would not bother most
   people. Genetic disorders, Hodgkin's disease, cancer chemotherapy, and radiation therapy can
   cause immunodeficiency diseases.

   Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) results from a complete absence of the cell-mediated and
   antibody-mediated immune responses. Affected individuals suffer from a series of seemingly minor
   infections and usually die at an early age. A small group suffering from adenosine deaminase
   (ADA) deficiency, a type of SCID, are undergoing gene therapy to provide them with normal copies
   of the defective gene.

   Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is currently receiving the most attention among the
   immunodeficiency diseases. AIDS is a collection of disorders resulting from the destruction of T
   cells by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), a retrovirus. When HIV replicates in the human
   T cells, it buds from the T cell plasma membrane encased in a coat derived from the T cell
   plasma membrane. HIV selectively infects and kills T4 helper cells. The viral RNA is converted
   into DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase; this DNA can become incorporated into a human
   chromosome for months or years.

   When the infected T cell is needed in the immune response, the viral genes are activated and the
   virus replicates, killing the infected cell and producing a new round on T4 cell infection.
   Gradually the number of T4 cells, the master on switch for the immune system, decline. The
   immune response grows less powerful, eventually failing. Premature death results from a series
   of rare diseases (such as fungal pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare cancer) that overwhelm
   the body and its compromised immune system.
