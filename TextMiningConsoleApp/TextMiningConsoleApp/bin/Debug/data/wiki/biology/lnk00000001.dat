Biology: The Science of Our Lives | Back to Top

   Biology literally means "the study of life". Biology is such a broad field, covering the minute
   workings of chemical machines inside our cells, to broad scale concepts of ecosystems and global
   climate change. Biologists study intimate details of the human brain, the composition of our
   genes, and even the functioning of our reproductive system. Biologists recently all but
   completed the deciphering of the human genome, the sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bases
   that may determine much of our innate capabilities and predispositions to certain forms of
   behavior and illnesses. DNA sequences have played major roles in criminal cases (O.J. Simpson,
   as well as the reversal of death penalties for many wrongfully convicted individuals), as well
   as the impeachment of President Clinton (the stain at least did not lie). We are bombarded with
   headlines about possible health risks from favorite foods (Chinese, Mexican, hamburgers, etc.)
   as well as the potential benefits of eating other foods such as cooked tomatoes. Informercials
   tout the benefits of metabolism-adjusting drugs for weight loss. Many Americans are turning to
   herbal remedies to ease arthritis pain, improve memory, as well as improve our moods.

   Can a biology book give you the answers to these questions? No, but it will enable you learn how
   to sift through the biases of investigators, the press, and others in a quest to critically
   evaluate the question. To be honest, five years after you are through with this class it is
   doubtful you would remember all the details of meatbolism. However, you will know where to look
   and maybe a little about the process of science that will allow you to make an informed
   decision. Will you be a scientist? Yes, in a way. You may not be formally trained as a science
   major, but you can think critically, solve problems, and have some idea about what science can
   and cannoit do. I hope you will be able to tell the shoe from the shinola.

Science and the Scientific Method | Back to Top

   Science is an objective, logical, and repeatable attempt to understand the principles and forces
   operating in the natural universe. Science is from the Latin word, scientia, to know. Good
   science is not dogmatic, but should be viewed as an ongoing process of testing and evaluation.
   One of the hoped-for benefits of students taking a biology course is that they will become more
   familiar with the process of science.

   Humans seem innately interested in the world we live in. Young children drive their parents
   batty with constant "why" questions. Science is a means to get some of those whys answered. When
   we shop for groceries, we are conducting a kind of scientific experiment. If you like Brand X of
   soup, and Brand Y is on sale, perhaps you try Brand Y. If you like it you may buy it again, even
   when it is not on sale. If you did not like Brand Y, then no sale will get you to try it again.

   In order to conduct science, one must know the rules of the game (imagine playing Monopoly and
   having to discover the rules as you play! Which is precisely what one does with some computer or
   videogames (before buying the cheatbook). The scientific method is to be used as a guide that
   can be modified. In some sciences, such as taxonomy and certain types of geology, laboratory
   experiments are not necessarily performed. Instead, after formulating a hypothesis, additional
   observations and/or collections are made from different localities.

   Steps in the scientific method commonly include:
    1. Observation: defining the problem you wish to explain.
    2. Hypothesis: one or more falsifiable explanations for the observation.
    3. Experimentation: Controlled attempts to test one or more hypotheses.
    4. Conclusion: was the hypothesis supported or not? After this step the hypothesis is either
       modified or rejected, which causes a repeat of the steps above.

   After a hypothesis has been repeatedly tested, a hierarchy of scientific thought develops.
   Hypothesis is the most common, with the lowest level of certainty. A theory is a hypothesis that
   has been repeatedly tested with little modification, e.g. The Theory of Evolution. A Law is one
   of the fundamental underlying principles of how the Universe is organized, e.g. The Laws of
   Thermodynamics, Newton's Law of Gravity. Science uses the word theory differently than it is
   used in the general population. Theory to most people, in general nonscientific use, is an
   untested idea. Scientists call this a hypothesis.

   Scientific experiments are also concerned with isolating the variables. A good science
   experiment does not simultaneously test several variables, but rather a single variable that can
   be measured against a control. Scientific controlled experiments are situations where all
   factors are the same between two test subjects, except for the single experimental variable.

   Consider a commonly conducted science fair experiment. Sandy wants to test the effect of gangsta
   rap music on pea plant growth. She plays loud rap music 24 hours a day to a series of pea plants
   grown under light, and watered every day. At the end of her experiment she concludes gangsta rap
   is conducive to plant growth. Her teacher grades her project very low, citing the lack of a
   control group for the experiment. Sandy returns to her experiment, but this time she has a
   separate group of plants under the same conditions as the rapping plants, but with soothing Led
   Zeppelin songs playing. She comes to the same conclusion as before, but now has a basis for
   comparison. Her teacher gives her project a better grade.

Theories Contributing to Modern Biology | Back to Top

   Modern biology is based on several great ideas, or theories:
    1. The Cell Theory
    2. The Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection
    3. Gene Theory
    4. Homeostasis

   Robert Hooke (1635-1703), one of the first scientists to use a microscope to examine pond water,
   cork and other things, referred to the cavities he saw in cork as "cells", Latin for chambers.
   Mattias Schleiden (in 1838) concluded all plant tissues consisted of cells. In 1839, Theodore
   Schwann came to a similar conclusion for animal tissues. Rudolf Virchow, in 1858, combined the
   two ideas and added that all cells come from pre-existing cells, formulating the Cell Theory.
   Thus there is a chain-of-existence extending from your cells back to the earliest cells, over
   3.5 billion years ago. The cell theory states that all organisms are composed of one or more
   cells, and that those cells have arisen from pre-existing cells.

   Figure 1. James Watson (L) and Francis Crick (R), and the model they built of the structure of
   deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA. While a model may seem a small thing, their development of the DNA
   model fostered increased understanding of how genes work. Image from the Internet.

   [aWatson%26Crick.jpg]

   In 1953, American scientist James Watson and British scientist Francis Crick developed the model
   for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a chemical that had (then) recently been deduced to be the
   physical carrier of inheritance. Crick hypothesized the mechanism for DNA replication and
   further linked DNA to proteins, an idea since referred to as the central dogma. Information from
   DNA "language" is converted into RNA (ribonucleic acid) "language" and then to the "language" of
   proteins. The central dogma explains the influence of heredity (DNA) on the organism (proteins).

   Homeostasis is the maintainence of a dynamic range of conditions within which the organism can
   function. Temperature, pH, and energy are major components of this concept. Theromodynamics is a
   field of study that covers the laws governing energy transfers, and thus the basis for life on
   earth. Two major laws are known: the conservation of matter and energy, and entropy. These will
   be discussed in more detail in a later chapter. The universe is composed of two things: matter
   (atoms, etc.) and energy.

   These first three theories are very accepted by scientists and the general public. The theory of
   evolution is well accepted by scientists and most of the general public. However, it remains a
   lightening rod for school boards, politicians, and television preachers. Much of this confusion
   results from what the theory says and what it does not say.

Development of the Theory of Evolution | Back to Top

   Modern biology is based on several unifying themes, such as the cell theory, genetics and
   inheritance, Francis Crick's central dogma of information flow, and Darwin and Wallace's theory
   of evolution by natural selection. In this first unit we will examine these themes and the
   nature of science.

   The Ancient Greek philosopher Anaxiamander (611-547 B.C.) and the Roman philosopher Lucretius
   (99-55 B.C.) coined the concept that all living things were related and that they had changed
   over time. The classical science of their time was observational rather than experimental.
   Another ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle developed his Scala Naturae, or Ladder of Life, to
   explain his concept of the advancement of living things from inanimate matter to plants, then
   animals and finally man. This concept of man as the "crown of creation" still plagues modern
   evolutionary biologists (See Gould, 1989, for a more detailed discussion).

   Post-Aristotlean "scientists" were constrained by the prevailing thought patterns of the Middle
   Ages -- the inerrancy of the biblical book of Genesis and the special creation of the world in a
   literal six days of the 24-hour variety. Archbishop James Ussher of Ireland, in the late 1600's
   calculated the age of the earth based on the geneologies from Adam and Eve listed in the
   biblical book of Genesis. According to Ussher's calculations, the earth was formed on October
   22, 4004 B.C. These calculations were part of Ussher's book, History of the World. The
   chronology he developed was taken as factual, and was even printed in the front pages of bibles.
   Ussher's ideas were readily accepted, in part because they posed no threat to the social order
   of the times; comfortable ideas that would not upset the linked applecarts of church and state.

Figure 2. Archbishop James Ussher. Image from the Internet.

                                                                                                     [ussher.gif]

   Often new ideas must "come out of left field", appearing as wild notions, but in many cases
   prompting investigation which may later reveal the "truth". Ussher's ideas were comfortable, the
   Bible was viewed as correct, therefore the earth must be only 5000 years old.

   Geologists had for some time doubted the "truth" of a 5,000 year old earth. Leonardo da Vinci
   (painter of the Last Supper, and the Mona Lisa, architect and engineer) calculated the
   sedimentation rates in the Po River of Italy. Da Vinci concluded it took 200,000 years to form
   some nearby rock deposits. Galileo, convicted heretic for his contention that the Earth was not
   the center of the Universe, studied fossils (evidence of past life) and concluded that they were
   real and not inanimate artifacts. James Hutton, regarded as the Father of modern geology,
   developed the Theory of Uniformitarianism, the basis of modern geology and paleontology.
   According to Hutton's work, certain geological processes operated in the past in much the same
   fashion as they do today, with minor exceptions of rates, etc. Thus many geological structures
   and processes cannot be explained if the earth was only a mere 5000 years old.

The Modern View of the Age of the Earth | Back to Top

   Radiometric age assignments based on the rates of decay of radioactive isotopes, not discovered
   until the late 19th century, suggest the earth is over 4.5 billion years old. The Earth is
   thought older than 4.5 billion years, with the oldest known rocks being 3.96 billion years old.
   Geologic time divides into eons, eroas, and smaller units. An overview of geologic time may be
   obtained at http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/help/timeform.html.

Development of the modern view of Evolution | Back to Top

   Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802; grandfather of Charles Darwin) a British physician and poet in the
   late 1700's, proposed that life had changed over time, although he did not present a mechanism.
   Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (pronounced Bu-fone; 1707-1788) in the middle to late
   1700's proposed that species could change. This was a major break from earlier concepts that
   species were created by a perfect creator and therefore could not change because they were
   perfect, etc.

   Swedish botanist Carl Linne (more popularly known as Linneus, after the common practice of the
   day which was to latinize names of learned men), attempted to pigeon-hole all known species of
   his time (1753) into immutable categories. Many of these categories are still used in biology,
   although the underlying thought concept is now evolution and not immutability of species.
   Linnean hierarchical classification was based on the premise that the species was the smallest
   unit, and that each species (or taxon) belonged to a higher category.

   Kingdom Animalia

     Phylum (Division is used for plants) Chordata

     Class Mammalia

     Order Primates

     Family Hominidae

     Genus Homo

     species sapiens

          This image is from http://linnaeus.nrm.se/botany/fbo/welcome.html.en. [lport.jpg]

   Linneus also developed the concept of binomial nomenclature, whereby scientists speaking and
   writing different languages could communicate clearly. For example Man in English is Hombre in
   Spanish, Mensch in German, and Homo in Latin. Linneus settled on Latin, which was the language
   of learned men at that time. If a scientist refers to Homo, all scientists know what he or she
   means.

   William "Strata" Smith (1769-1839), employed by the English coal mining industry, developed the
   first accurate geologic map of England. He also, from his extensive travels, developed the
   Principle of Biological Succession. This idea states that each period of Earth history has its
   own unique assemblages of fossils. In essence Smith fathered the science of stratigraphy, the
   correlation of rock layers based on (among other things) their fossil contents. He also
   developed an idea that life had changed over time, but did not overtly state that.

   Abraham Gottlob Werner and Baron Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) were among the foremost proponents
   of catastrophism, the theory that the earth and geological events had formed suddenly, as a
   result of some great catastrophe (such as Noah's flood). This view was a comfortable one for the
   times and thus was widely accepted. Cuvier eventually proposed that there had been several
   creations that occurred after catastrophies. Louis Agassiz (1807-1873) proposed 50-80
   catastrophies and creations.

   Jean Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829) developed one of the first theories on how species changed.
   He proposed the inheritance of acquired characteristics to explain, among other things, the
   length of the giraffe neck. The Lamarckian view is that modern giraffe's have long necks because
   their ancestors progressively gained longer necks due to stretching to reach food higher and
   higher in trees. According to the 19th century concept of use and disuse the stretching of necks
   resulted in their development, which was somehow passed on to their progeny. Today we realize
   that only bacteria are able to incorporate non-genetic (nonheritable) traits. Lamarck's work was
   a theory that plainly stated that life had changed over time and provided (albeit an erroneous)
   mechanism of change.

   Additional information about the biological thoughts of Lamarck is available by clicking here.

Darwinian evolution | Back to Top

   Charles Darwin, former divinity student and former medical student, secured (through the
   intercession of his geology professor) an unpaid position as ship's naturalist on the British
   exploratory vessel H.M.S. Beagle. The voyage would provide Darwin a unique opportunity to study
   adaptation and gather a great deal of proof he would later incorporate into his theory of
   evolution. On his return to England in 1836, Darwin began (with the assistance of numerous
   specialists) to catalog his collections and ponder the seeming "fit" of organisms to their mode
   of existence. He eventually settled on four main points of a radical new hypothesis:
    1. Adaptation: all organisms adapt to their environments.
    2. Variation: all organisms are variable in their traits.
    3. Over-reproduction: all organisms tend to reproduce beyond their environment's capacity to
       support them (this is based on the work of Thomas Malthus, who studied how populations of
       organisms tended to grow geometrically until they encountered a limit on their population
       size).
    4. Since not all organisms are equally well adapted to their environment, some will survive and
       reproduce better than others -- this is known as natural selection. Sometimes this is also
       referred to as "survival of the fittest". In reality this merely deals with the reproductive
       success of the organisms, not solely their relative strength or speed.

    Figure 4. Charles Darwin (right) and Alfred Wallace (left), the co-developers of the theory of
    evolution by means of natural selection. Image of Charles Darwin from

    from http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/schools/phs/science_Dept/APBio/Natural_Selection.html.


    [Wallace,Alfred.GIF]

                        [Darwin.jpg]

   Unlike the upper-class Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) came from a different social
   class. Wallace spent many years in South America, publishing salvaged notes in Travels on the
   Amazon and Rio Negro in 1853. In 1854, Wallace left England to study the natural history of
   Indonesia, where he contracted malaria. During a fever Wallace managed to write down his ideas
   on natural selection.

   In 1858, Darwin received a letter from Wallace, in which Darwin's as-yet-unpublished theory of
   evolution and adaptation was precisely detailed. Darwin arranged for Wallace's letter to be read
   at a scientific meeting, along with a synopsis of his own ideas. To be correct, we need to
   mention that both Darwin and Wallace developed the theory, although Darwin's major work was not
   published until 1859 (the book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection,
   considered by many as one of the most influential books written [follow the hyperlink to view an
   online version]). While there have been some changes to the theory since 1859, most notably the
   incorporation of genetics and DNA into what is termed the "Modern Synthesis" during the 1940's,
   most scientists today acknowledge evolution as the guiding theory for modern biology.

   Recent revisions of biology curricula stressed the need for underlying themes. Evolution serves
   as such a universal theme. An excellent site devoted to Darwin's thoughts and work is available
   by clicking here. At that same site is a timeline showing many of the events mentioned above in
   their historical contexts.

The Diversity of Life | Back to Top

   Evolutionary theory and the cell theory provide us with a basis for the interrelation of all
   living things. We also utilize Linneus' hierarchical classification system, adopting (generally)
   five kingdoms of living organisms. Viruses, as discussed later, are not considered living. Click
   here for a table summarizing the five kingdoms. Recent studies suggest that there might be a
   sixth Kingdom, the Archaea.

                                               Examples

   Monera

   (in the broadest sense, including organisms usually placed in the Domain Archaea).

   Photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, decomposer, parasitic.

   Single-celled, filament, or colony of cells; all prokaryotic.

   Monerans play various roles in almost all food chains, including producer,consumer, and
   decomposer.

   Cyanobacteria are important oxygen producers.

   Many Monerans also produce nitrogen, vitamins, antibiotics, and are important compoents in human
   and animal intestines.

   Bacteria (E. coli), cyanobacteria (Oscillatoria), methanogens, and thermacidophiles.

   Protista

   Photosynthesis, absorb food from environment, or trap/engulf smaller organisms.

   Single-celled, filamentous, colonial, and multicelled; all eukaryotic.

   Important producers in ocean/pond food chain.

   Source of food in some human cultures.

   Phytoplankton component that is one of the major producers of oxygen

   Plankton (both phytoplankton and zooplankton), algae (kelp, diatoms, dinoflagellates),and
   Protozoa (Amoeba, Paramecium).

   Fungi

   Absorb food from a host or from their environment.

   All heterotrophic.

   Single-celled, filamentous, to multicelled; all eukaryotic.

   Decomposer, parasite, and consumer.

   Produce antibiotics,help make bread and alcohol.

   Crop parasites (Dutch Elm Disease, Karnal Bunt, Corn Smut, etc.).

    Mushrooms (Agaricus campestris, the commercial mushroom), molds, mildews, rusts and smuts
   (plant parasites), yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisae, the brewer's yeast).

   Plantae

   Almost all photosynthetic, although a few parasitic plants are known.

   All multicelled, photosynthetic, autotrophs..

   Food source, medicines and drugs, dyes, building material, fuel.

   Producer in most food chains.

   Angiosperms (oaks, tulips, cacti),gymnosperms (pines, spuce, fir), mosses, ferns,liverworts,
   horsetails (Equisetum, the scouring rush)

   Animalia

   All heterotrophic.

   Multicelled heterotrophs capable of movement at some stage during their life history (even couch
   potatoes).

   Consumer level in most food chains (herbivores,carnivores,omnivores).

   Food source, beasts of burden and transportation, recreation, and companionship.

   Sponges, worms,molluscs, insects, starfish,mammals, amphibians,fish, birds, reptiles, and
   dinosaurs, and people.

   Monera, the most primitive kingdom, contain living organisms remarkably similar to ancient
   fossils. Organisms in this group lack membrane-bound organelles associated with higher forms of
   life. Such organisms are known as prokaryotes. Bacteria (technically the Eubacteria) and
   blue-green bacteria (sometimes called blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria) are the major forms of
   life in this kingdom. The most primitive group, the archaebacteria, are today restricted to
   marginal habitats such as hot springs or areas of low oxygen concentration.

   Protista were the first of the eukaryotic kingdoms, these organisms and all others have
   membrane-bound organelles, which allow for compartmentalization and dedication of specific areas
   for specific functions. The chief importance of Protista is their role as a stem group for the
   remaining Kingdoms: Plants, Animals, and Fungi. Major groups within the Protista include the
   algae, euglenoids, ciliates, protozoa, and flagellates.

   Fungi are almost entirely multicellular (with yeast, Saccharomyces cerviseae, being a prominent
   unicellular fungus), heterotrophic (deriving their energy from another organism, whether alive
   or dead), and usually having some cells with two nuclei (multinucleate, as opposed to the more
   common one, or uninucleate) per cell. Ecologically this kingdom is important (along with certain
   bacteria) as decomposers and recyclers of nutrients. Economically, the Fungi provide us with
   food (mushrooms; Bleu cheese/Roquefort cheese; baking and brewing), antibiotics (the first of
   the wonder drugs, penicillin, was isolated from a fungus Penicillium), and crop parasites (doing
   several billion dollars per year of damage).

   Plantae (click here for more information about the Plantae) include multicelled organisms that
   are all autotrophic (capable of making their own food by the process of photosynthesis, the
   conversion of sunlight energy into chemical energy). Ecologically, this kingdom is generally
   (along with photosynthetic organisms in Monera and Protista) termed the producers, and rest at
   the base of all food webs. A food web is an ecological concept to trace energy flow through an
   ecosystem. Economically, this kingdom is unparalleled, with agriculture providing billions of
   dollars to the economy (as well as the foundation of "civilization"). Food, building materials,
   paper, drugs (both legal and illegal), and roses, are plants or plant-derived products.

   Animalia consists entirely of multicelluar heterotrophs that are all capable (at some point
   during their life history) of mobility. Ecologically, this kingdom occupies the level of
   consumers, which can be subdivided into herbivore (eaters of plants) and carnivores (eaters of
   other animals). Humans, along with some other organisms, are omnivores (capable of functioning
   as herbivores or carnivores). Economically, animals provide meat, hides, beasts of burden,
   pleasure (pets), transportation, and scents (as used in some perfumes).

Characteristics of living things | Back to Top

   Living things have a variety of common characteristics.
     * Organization. Living things exhibit a high level of organization, with multicellular
       organisms being subdivided into cells, and cells into organelles, and organelles into
       molecules, etc.
     * Homeostasis. Homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant (yet also dynamic) internal
       environment in terms of temperature, pH, water concentrations, etc. Much of our own
       metabolic energy goes toward keeping within our own homeostatic limits. If you run a high
       fever for long enough, the increased temperature will damage certain organs and impair your
       proper functioning. Swallowing of common household chemicals, many of which are outside the
       pH (acid/base) levels we can tolerate, will likewise negatively impact the human body's
       homeostatic regime. Muscular activity generates heat as a waste product. This heat is
       removed from our bodies by sweating. Some of this heat is used by warm-blooded animals,
       mammals and birds, to maintain their internal temperatures.
     * Adaptation. Living things are suited to their mode of existence. Charles Darwin began the
       recognition of the marvellous adaptations all life has that allow those organisms to exist
       in their environment.
     * Reproduction and heredity. Since all cells come from existing cells, they must have some way
       of reproducing, whether that involves asexual (no recombination of genetic material) or
       sexual (recombination of genetic material). Most living things use the chemical DNA
       (deoxyribonucleic acid) as the physical carrier of inheritance and the genetic information.
       Some organisms, such as retroviruses (of which HIV is a member), use RNA (ribonucleic acid)
       as the carrier. The variation that Darwin and Wallace recognized as the wellspring of
       evolution and adaptation, is greatly increased by sexual reproduction.
     * Growth and development. Even single-celled organisms grow. When first formed by cell
       division, they are small, and must grow and develop into mature cells. Multicellular
       organisms pass through a more complicated process of differentiation and organogenesis
       (because they have so many more cells to develop).
     * Energy acquisition and release. One view of life is that it is a struggle to acquire energy
       (from sunlight, inorganic chemicals, or another organism), and release it in the process of
       forming ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
     * Detection and response to stimuli (both internal and external).
     * Interactions. Living things interact with their environment as well as each other. Organisms
       obtain raw materials and energy from the environment or another organism. The various types
       of symbioses (organismal interactions with each other) are examples of this.

Levels of Organization | Back to Top

   Biosphere: The sum of all living things taken in conjunction with their environment. In essence,
   where life occurs, from the upper reaches of the atmosphere to the top few meters of soil, to
   the bottoms of the oceans. We divide the earth into atmosphere (air), lithosphere (earth),
   hydrosphere (water), and biosphere (life).

   Ecosystem: The relationships of a smaller groups of organisms with each other and their
   environment. Scientists often speak of the interrelatedness of living things. Since, according
   to Darwin's theory, organisms adapt to their environment, they must also adapt to other
   organisms in that environment. We can discuss the flow of energy through an ecosystem from
   photosynthetic autotrophs to herbivores to carnivores.

   Community: The relationships between groups of different species. For example, the desert
   communities consist of rabbits, coyotes, snakes, birds, mice and such plants as sahuaro cactus
   (Carnegia gigantea), Ocotillo, creosote bush, etc. Community structure can be disturbed by such
   things as fire, human activity, and over-population.

   Species: Groups of similar individuals who tend to mate and produce viable, fertile offspring.
   We often find species described not by their reproduction (a biological species) but rather by
   their form (anatomical or form species).

   Populations: Groups of similar individuals who tend to mate with each other in a limited
   geographic area. This can be as simple as a field of flowers, which is separated from another
   field by a hill or other area where none of these flowers occur.

   Individuals: One or more cells characterized by a unique arrangement of DNA "information". These
   can be unicellular or multicellular. The multicellular individual exhibits specialization of
   cell types and division of labor into tissues, organs, and organ systems.

   Organ System: (in multicellular organisms). A group of cells, tissues, and organs that perform a
   specific major function. For example: the cardiovascular system functions in circulation of
   blood.

   Organ: (in multicellular organisms). A group of cells or tissues performing an overall function.
   For example: the heart is an organ that pumps blood within the cardiovascular system.

   Tissue: (in multicellular organisms). A group of cells performing a specific function. For
   example heart muscle tissue is found in the heart and its unique contraction properties aid the
   heart's functioning as a pump. .

   Cell: The fundamental unit of living things. Each cell has some sort of hereditary material
   (either DNA or more rarely RNA), energy acquiring chemicals, structures, etc. Living things, by
   definition, must have the metabolic chemicals plus a nucleic acid hereditary information
   molecule.

   Organelle: A subunit of a cell, an organelle is involved in a specific subcellular function, for
   example the ribosome (the site of protein synthesis) or mitochondrion (the site of ATP
   generation in eukaryotes).

   Molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles: The fundamental functional levels of biochemistry.

   It is thus possible to study biology at many levels, from collections of organisms
   (communities), to the inner workings of a cell (organelle).
