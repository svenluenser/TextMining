   Cells produce water and carbon dioxide as by-products of metabolic breakdown of sugars, fats,
   and proteins. Chemical groups such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorous must be stripped, from
   the large molecules to which they were formerly attached, as part of preparing them for energy
   conversion. The continuous production of metabolic wastes establishes a steep concentration
   gradient across the plasma membrane, causing wastes to diffuse out of cells and into the
   extracellular fluid.

   Single-celled organisms have most of their wastes diffuse out into the outside environment.
   Multicellular organisms, and animals in particular, must have a specialized organ system to
   concentrate and remove wastes from the interstitial fluid into the blood capillaries and
   eventually deposit that material at a collection point for removal entirely from the body.

  Regulation of Extracellular Fluids | Back to Top

   Excretory systems regulate the chemical composition of body fluids by removing metabolic wastes
   and retaining the proper amounts of water, salts, and nutrients. Components of this system in
   vertebrates include the kidneys, liver, lungs, and skin.

   Not all animals use the same routes or excrete their wastes the same way humans do. Excretion
   applies to metabolic waste products that cross a plasma membrane. Elimination is the removal of
   feces.

  Nitrogen Wastes | Back to Top

   Nitrogen wastes are a by product of protein metabolism. Amino groups are removed from amino
   acids prior to energy conversion. The NH[2] (amino group) combines with a hydrogen ion (proton)
   to form ammonia (NH[3]).

   Ammonia is very toxic and usually is excreted directly by marine animals. Terrestrial animals
   usually need to conserve water. Ammonia is converted to urea, a compound the body can tolerate
   at higher concentrations than ammonia. Birds and insects secrete uric acid that they make
   through large energy expenditure but little water loss. Amphibians and mammals secrete urea that
   they form in their liver. Amino groups are turned into ammonia, which in turn is converted to
   urea, dumped into the blood and concentrated by the kidneys.

  Water and Salt Balance | Back to Top

   The excretory system is responsible for regulating water balance in various body fluids.
   Osmoregulation refers to the state aquatic animals are in: they are surrounded by freshwater and
   must constantly deal with the influx of water. Animals, such as crabs, have an internal salt
   concentration very similar to that of the surrounding ocean. Such animals are known as
   osmoconformers, as there is little water transport between the inside of the animal and the
   isotonic outside environment.

   Marine vertebrates, however, have internal concentrations of salt that are about one-third of
   the surrounding seawater. They are said to be osmoregulators. Osmoregulators face two problems:
   prevention of water loss from the body and prevention of salts diffusing into the body. Fish
   deal with this by passing water out of their tissues through their gills by osmosis and salt
   through their gills by active transport. Cartilaginous fish have a greater salt concentration
   than seawater, causing water to move into the shark by osmosis; this water is used for
   excretion. Freshwater fish must prevent water gain and salt loss. They do not drink water, and
   have their skin covered by a thin mucus. Water enters and leaves through the gills and the fish
   excretory system produces large amounts of dilute urine.

   Terrestrial animals use a variety of methods to reduce water loss: living in moist environments,
   developing impermeable body coverings, production of more concentrated urine. Water loss can be
   considerable: a person in a 100 degree F temperature loses 1 liter of water per hour.

  Excretory System Functions | Back to Top

    1. Collect water and filter body fluids.
    2. Remove and concentrate waste products from body fluids and return other substances to body
       fluids as necessary for homeostasis.
    3. Eliminate excretory products from the body.

  Invertebrate Excretory Organs | Back to Top

   Many invertebrates such as flatworms use a nephridium as their excretory organ. At the end of
   each blind tubule of the nephridium is a ciliated flame cell. As fluid passes down the tubule,
   solutes are reabsorbed and returned to the body fluids.

   Body fluids are drawn into the Malphigian tubules by osmosis due to large concentrations of
   potassium inside the tubule. Body fluids pass back into the body, nitrogenous wastes empty into
   the insect's gut. Water is reabsorbed and waste is expelled from the insect.

  Vertebrates Have Paired Kidneys | Back to Top

   ALL vertebrates have paired kidneys. Excretion is not the primary function of kidneys. Kidneys
   regulate body fluid levels as a primary duty, and remove wastes as a secondary one.

  The Human Excretory System | Back to Top

   The urinary system is made-up of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The nephron, an
   evolutionary modification of the nephridium, is the kidney's functional unit. Waste is filtered
   from the blood and collected as urine in each kidney. Urine leaves the kidneys by ureters, and
   collects in the bladder. The bladder can distend to store urine that eventually leaves through
   the urethra.

    The Nephron

   The nephron consists of a cup-shaped capsule containing capillaries and the glomerulus, and a
   long renal tube. Blood flows into the kidney through the renal artery, which branches into
   capillaries associated with the glomerulus. Arterial pressure causes water and solutes from the
   blood to filter into the capsule. Fluid flows through the proximal tubule, which include the
   loop of Henle, and then into the distal tubule. The distal tubule empties into a collecting
   duct. Fluids and solutes are returned to the capillaries that surround the nephron tubule.

   The nephron has three functions:
    1. Glomerular filtration of water and solutes from the blood.
    2. Tubular reabsorption of water and conserved molecules back into the blood.
    3. Tubular secretion of ions and other waste products from surrounding capillaries into the
       distal tubule.

   Nephrons filter 125 ml of body fluid per minute; filtering the entire body fluid component 16
   times each day. In a 24 hour period nephrons produce 180 liters of filtrate, of which 178.5
   liters are reabsorbed. The remaining 1.5 liters forms urine.

    Urine Production

    1. Filtration in the glomerulus and nephron capsule.
    2. Reabsorption in the proximal tubule.
    3. Tubular secretion in the Loop of Henle.

    Components of The Nephron

     * Glomerulus: mechanically filters blood
     * Bowman's Capsule: mechanically filters blood
     * Proximal Convoluted Tubule: Reabsorbs 75% of the water, salts, glucose, and amino acids
     * Loop of Henle: Countercurrent exchange, which maintains the concentration gradient
     * Distal Convoluted Tubule: Tubular secretion of H ions, potassium, and certain drugs.

    Kidney Stones

   In some cases, excess wastes crystallize as kidney stones. They grow and can become a painful
   irritant that may require surgery or ultrasound treatments. Some stones are small enough to be
   forced into the urethra, others are the size of huge, massive boulders (or so I am told).

  Kidney Function | Back to Top

   Kidneys perform a number of homeostatic functions:
    1. Maintain volume of extracellular fluid
    2. Maintain ionic balance in extracellular fluid
    3. Maintain pH and osmotic concentration of the extracellular fluid.
    4. Excrete toxic metabolic by-products such as urea, ammonia, and uric acid.

  Hormone Control of Water and Salt | Back to Top

   Water reabsorption is controlled by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in negative feedback. ADH is
   released from the pituitary gland in the brain. Dropping levels of fluid in the blood signal the
   hypothalamus to cause the pituitary to release ADH into the blood. ADH acts to increase water
   absorption in the kidneys. This puts more water back in the blood, increasing the concentration
   of the urine. When too much fluid is present in the blood, sensors in the heart signal the
   hypothalamus to cause a reduction of the amounts of ADH in the blood. This increases the amount
   of water absorbed by the kidneys, producing large quantities of a more dilute urine.

   Aldosterone, a hormone secreted by the kidneys, regulates the transfer of sodium from the
   nephron to the blood. When sodium levels in the blood fall, aldosterone is released into the
   blood, causing more sodium to pass from the nephron to the blood. This causes water to flow into
   the blood by osmosis. Renin is released into the blood to control aldosterone.

  Disruption of Kidney Function | Back to Top

   Infection, environmental toxins such as mercury, and genetic disease can have devastating
   results by causing disruption of kidney function. Many kidney problems can be treated by
   dialysis, where a machine acts as a kidney. Kidney transplants are an alternative to dialysis.
