  Origin of the Earth and Life | Back to Top

   Scientific estimates place the origin of the Universe at between 10 and 20 billion years ago.
   The theory currently with the most acceptance is the Big Bang Theory, the idea that all matter
   in the Universe existed in a cosmic egg (smaller than the size of a modern hydrogen atom) that
   exploded, forming the Universe. Recent discoveries from the Space Telescope and other devices
   suggest this theory smay need some modification. Evidence for the Big Bang includes:

     1) The Red Shift: when stars/galaxies are moving away from us the energy they emit is shifted
     to the red side of the visible-light spectrum. Those moving towards us are shifted to the
     violet side. This shift is an example of the Doppler effect. Similar effects are observed
     when listening to a train whistle-- it will sound higher (shorter wavelengths) approaching
     and lower (longer wavelengths) as it moves away. Likewise red wavelengths are longer than
     violet ones. Most galaxies appear to be moving away from ours.

     2) Background radiation: two Bell Labs scientists discovered that in interstellar space there
     is a slight background radiation, thought to be the residual afterblast remnant of the Big
     Bang. Click here for additional information from sites dealing with the Big Bang, or here for
     a Powerpoint slideshow about the Big Bang.

   Soon after the Big Bang the major forces (such as gravity, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear
   force, etc.) differentiated. While in the cosmic egg, scientists think that matter and energy as
   we understand them did not exist, but rather they formed soon after the bang. After 10 million
   to 1 billion years the universe became clumpy, with matter beginning to accumulate into solar
   systems. One of those solar systems, ours, began to form approximately 5 billion years ago, with
   a large "protostar" (that became our sun) in the center. The planets were in orbits some
   distance from the star, their increasing gravitational fields sweeping stray debris into larger
   and larger planetesimals that eventually formed planets.

   The processes of radioactive decay and heat generated by the impact of planetesimals heated the
   Earth, which then began to differentiate into a "cooled" outer cooled crust (of silicon, oxygen
   and other relatively light elements) and increasingly hotter inner areas (composed of the
   heavier and denser elements such as iron and nickel). Impact (asteroid, comet, planetismals) and
   the beginnings of volcanism released water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and other
   gases into a developing atmosphere. Sometime "soon" after this, life on Earth began.

  Where did life originate and how?

   Extra-terrestrial: In 1969, a meteorite (left-over bits from the origin of the solar system)
   landed near Allende, Mexico. The Allende Meteorite (and others of its sort) have been analyzed
   and found to contain amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, one of the four organic
   molecule groups basic to all life. The idea of panspermia hypothesized that life originated out
   in space and came to Earth inside a meteorite. Recently, this idea has been revived as Cosmic
   Ancestry. The amino acids recovered from meteorites are in a group known as exotics: they do not
   occur in the chemical systems of living things. The ET theory is now not considered by most
   scientists to be correct, although the August 1996 discovery of the Martian meteorite and its
   possible fossils have revived thought of life elsewhere in the Solar System.

   Supernatural: Since science is an attempt to measure and study the natural world, this theory is
   outside science (at least our current understanding of science). Science classes deal with
   science, and this idea is in the category of not-science.

   Organic Chemical Evolution: Until the mid-1800's scientists thought organic chemicals (those
   with a C-C skeleton) could only form by the actions of living things. A French scientist heated
   crystals of a mineral (a mineral is by definition inorganic), and discovered that they formed
   urea (an organic chemical) when they cooled. Russian scientist and academecian A.I. Oparin, in
   1922, hypothesized that cellular life was preceeded by a period of chemical evolution. These
   chemicals, he argued, must have arisen spontaneously under conditions exisitng billions of years
   ago (and quite unlike current conditions).

   In 1950, then-graduate student Stanley Miller designed an experimental test for Oparin's
   hypothesis. Oparin's original hypothesis called for : 1) little or no free oxygen (oxygen not
   bonded to other elements); and 2) C H O and N in abundance. Studies of modern volcanic eruptions
   support inference of the existence of such an atmosphere. Miller discharged an electric spark
   into a mixture thought to resemble the primordial composition of the atmosphere. Miller's
   atmosphere contents are shown in Figure 1. From the water receptacle, designed to model an
   ancient ocean, Miller recovered amino acids. Subsequent modifications of the atmosphere have
   produced representatives or precursors of all four organic macromolecular classes. His
   experimental apparatus is shown in Figure 2.

   The primordial Earth was a very different place than today, with greater amounts of energy,
   stronger storms, etc. The oceans were a "soup" of organic compounds that formed by inorganic
   processes (although this soup would not taste umm ummm good). Miller's (and subsequent)
   experiments have not proven life originated in this way, only that conditions thought to have
   existed over 3 billion years ago were such that the spontaneous (inorganic) formation of organic
   macromolecules could have taken place. The simple inorganic molecules that Miller placed into
   his apparatus, produced a variety of complex molecules, shown below in Figure 3.

   The interactions of these molecules would have increased as their concentrations increased.
   Reactions would have led to the building of larger, more complex molecules. A pre-cellular life
   would have began with the formation of nucleic acids. Chemicals made by these nucleic acids
   would have remained in proximity to the nucleic acids. Eventually the pre-cells would have been
   enclosed in a lipid-protein membrane, which would have resulted in the first cells.

   Biochemically, living systems are separated from other chemical systems by three things.
    1. The capacity for replication from one generation to another. Most organisms today use DNA as
       the hereditary material, although recent evidence (ribozymes) suggests that RNA may have
       been the first nucleic acid system to have formed. Nobel laureate Walter Gilbert refers to
       this as the RNA world. Recent studies suggest a molecular
    2. The presence of enzymes and other complex molecules essential to the processes needed by
       living systems. Miller's experiment showed how these could possibly form.
    3. A membrane that separates the internal chemicals from the external chemical environment.
       This also delimits the cell from not-cell areas. The work of Sidney W. Fox has produced
       proteinoid spheres, which while not cells, suggest a possible route from chemical to
       cellular life.

   Fossil evidence supports the origins of life on Earth earlier than 3.5 billion years ago. The
   North Pole microfossils from Australia, illustrated in Figure 4, are complex enough that more
   primitive cells must have existed earlier. From rocks of the Ishua Super Group in Greenland come
   possibly the earliest cells, as much as 3.8 billion years old. The oldest known rocks on Earth
   are 3.96 billion years old and are from Arctic Canada. Thus, life appears to have begun soon
   after the cooling of the Earth and formation of the atmosphere and oceans.

   Figure 4. Microfossils from the Apex Chert, North Pole, Australia. These organisms are Archean
   in age, approximately 3.465 billion years old, and resemble filamentous cyanobacteria. Image
   from http://www.astrobiology.ucla.edu/ESS116/L15/1515%20Apex%20Chert.jpg.

   These ancient fossils occur in marine rocks, such as limestones and sandstones, that formed in
   ancient oceans. The organisms living today that are most similar to ancient life forms are the
   archaebacteria. This group is today restricted to marginal environments. Recent discoveries of
   bacteria at mid-ocean ridges add yet another possible origin for life: at these mid-ocean ridges
   where heat and molten rock rise to the Earth's surface.

   Archaea and Eubacteria are similar in size and shape. When we do recover "bacteria" as fossils
   those are the two features we will usually see: size and shape. How can we distinguish between
   the two groups: the use of molecular fossils that will point to either (but not both) groups.
   Such a chemical fossil has been found and its presence in the Ishua rocks of Greenland (3.8
   billion years old) suggests that the archeans were present at that time.

Is there life on Mars, Venus, anywhere else?? | Back to Top

   The proximity of the Earth to the sun, the make-up of the Earth's crust (silicate mixtures,
   presence of water, etc.) and the size of the Earth suggest we may be unique in our own solar
   system, at least. Mars is smaller, farther from the sun, has a lower gravitational field (which
   would keep the atmosphere from escaping into space) and does show evidence of running water
   sometime in its past. If life did start on Mars, however, there appears to be no life (as we
   know it) today. Venus, the second planet, is closer to the sun, and appears similar to Earth in
   many respects. Carbon dioxide build-up has resulted in a "greenhouse planet" with strong storms
   and strongly acidic rain. Of all planets in the solar system, Venus is most likely to have some
   form of carbon-based life. The outer planets are as yet too poorly understood, although it seems
   unlikely that Jupiter or Saturn harbor life as we know it. Like Goldilocks would say "Venus is
   too hot, Mars is too cold, the Earth is just right!"

   Mars: In August 1996, evidence of life on Mars (or at least the chemistry of life), was
   announced. Click here to view that article and related ones. The results of years of study are
   inconclusive at best. The purported bacteria are much smaller than any known bacteria on Earth,
   were not hollow, and most could possibly have been mineral in origin. However, many scientists
   consider that the chemistry of life appears to have been established on Mars. Search for martian
   life (or its remains) continues.

   Heterotroph (other-feeder): an organism that obtains its energy from another organism. Animals,
   fungi, bacteria, and mant protistans are heterotrophs.

   Autotroph (self-feeder): an organism that makes its own food, it converts energy from an
   inorganic source in one of two ways. Photosynthesis is the conversion of sunlight energy into
   C-C covalent bonds of a carbohydrate, the process by which the vast majority of autotrophs
   obtain their energy. Chemosynthesis is the capture of energy released by certain inorganic
   chemical reactions. This is common in certain groups of likely that chemosynthesis predates
   photosynthesis. At mid-ocean ridges, scientists have discovered black smokers, vents that
   release chemicals into the water. These chemical reactions could have powered early ecosystems
   prior to the development of an ozone layer that would have permitted life to occupy the
   shallower parts of the ocean. Evidence of the antiquity of photosynthesis includes: a)
   biochemical precursors to photosynthesis chemicals have been synthesized in experiments; and b)
   when placed in light, these chemicals undergo chemical reactions similar to some that occur in
   primitive photosynthetic bacteria.

   Prokaryotes are among the most primitive forms of life on Earth. Remember that primitive does
   not necessarily equate to outdated and unworkable in an evolutionary sense, since primitive
   bacteria seem little changed, and thus may be viewed as well adapted, for over 3.5 Ga.
   Prokaryote (pro=before, karyo=nucleus): these organisms lack membrane-bound organelles, as seen
   in Figures 5 and 6. Some internal membrane organization is observable in a few prokaryotic
   autotrophs, such as the photosynthetic membranes associated with the photosynthetic chemicals in
   the photosynthetic bacterium Prochloron. (click here to view Prochloron and other cyanobacteria
   at the Tree of Life Page). A transmission electron micrograph of Prochloron is shown in Figure
   5.

   The Cell Theory is one of the foundations of modern biology. Its major tenets are:
     * All living things are composed of one or more cells;
     * The chemical reactions of living cells take place within cells;
     * All cells originate from pre-existing cells; and
     * Cells contain hereditary information, which is passed from one generation to another.

Components of Cells | Back to Top

   Cell Membrane (also known as plasma membrane or plasmalemma) is surrounds all cells. It: 1)
   separates the inner parts of the cell from the outer environment; and 2) acts as a selectively
   permeable barrier to allow certain chemicals, namely water, to pass and others to not pass. In
   multicellular organisms certain chemicals on the membrane surface act in the recognition of
   self. Antigens are substances located on the outside of cells, viruses and in some cases other
   chemicals. Antibodies are chemicals (Y-shaped) produced by an animal in response to a specific
   antigen. This is the basis of immunity and vaccination.

   Hereditary material (both DNA and RNA) is needed for a cell to be able to replicate and/or
   reproduce. Most organisms use DNA. Viruses and viroids sometimes employ RNA as their hereditary
   material. Retroviruses include HIV (Human Immunodefficiency Virus, the causative agent of AIDS)
   and Feline Leukemia Virus (the only retrovirus for which a successful vaccine has been
   developed). Viroids are naked pieces of RNA that lack cytoplasm, membranes, etc. They are
   parasites of some plants and also as possible glimpses of the functioning of pre-cellular life
   forms. Prokaryotic DNA is organized as a circular chromosome contained in an area known as a
   nucleoid. Eukaryotic DNA is organized in linear structures, the eukaryotic chromosomes, which
   are associations of DNA and histone proteins contained within a double membrane nuclear
   envelope, an area known as the cell nucleus.

   Organelles are formed bodies within the cytoplasm that perform certain functions. Some
   organelles are surrounded by membranes, we call these membrane-bound organelles.

   Ribosomes are the tiny structures where proteins synthesis occurs. They are not membrane-bound
   and occur in all cells, although there are differences between the size of subunits in
   eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes.

   The Cell Wall is a structure surrounding the plasma membrane. Prokaryote and eukaryote (if they
   have one) cell walls differ in their structure and chemical composition. Plant cells have
   cellulose in their cell walls, other organisims have different materials cpmprising their walls.
   Animals are distinct as a group in their lack of a cell wall.

   Membrane-bound organelles occur only in eukaryotic cells. They will be discussed in detail
   later. Eukaryotic cells are generally larger than prokaryotic cells. Internal complexity is
   usually greater in eukaryotes, with their compartmentalized membrane-bound organelles, than in
   prokaryotes. Some prokaryotes, such as Anabaena azollae, and Prochloron, have internal membranes
   associated with photosynthetic pigments.

The Origins of Multicellularity | Back to Top

   The oldest accepted prokaryote fossils date to 3.5 billion years; Eukaryotic fossils to between
   750 million years and possibly as old as 1.2-1.5 billion years. Multicellular fossils,
   purportedly of animals, have been recovered from 750Ma rocks in various parts of the world. The
   first eukaryotes were undoubtedly Protistans, a group that is thought to have given rise to the
   other eukaryotic kingdoms. Multicellularity allows specialization of function, for example
   muscle fibers are specialized for contraction, neuron cells for transmission of nerve messages.

  Microscopes | Back to Top

   Microscopes are important tools for studying cellular structures. In this class we will use
   light microscopes for our laboratory observations. Your text will also show light
   photomicrographs (pictures taken with a light microscope) and electron micrographs (pictures
   taken with an electron microscope). There are many terms and concepts which will help you in
   maximizing your study of microscopy.

   There are many different types of microscopes used in studying biology. These include the light
   microscopes (dissecting, compound brightfield, and compound phase-contrast), electron
   microscopes (transmission and scanning), and atomic force microscope.

   The microscope is an important tool used by biologists to magnify small objects. There are
   several concepts fundamental to microscopy.

     Magnification is the ratio of enlargement (or eduction) between the specimen and its image
     (either printed photograph or the virtual image seen through the eyepiece). To calculate
     magnification we multiply the power of each lens through which the light from the specimen
     passes, indicating that product as GGGX, where GGG is the product. For example: if the light
     passes through two,lenses (an objective lens and an ocular lens) we multiply the 10X ocular
     value by the value of the objective lens (say it is 4X): 10 X 4=40, or 40X magnification.

     Resolution is the ability to distinguish between two objects (or points). The closer the two
     objects are, the easier it is to distinguish recognize the distance between them. What
     microscopes do is to bring small objects "closer" to the observer by increasing the
     magnification of the sample. Since the sample is the same distance from the viewer, a
     "virtual image" is formed as the light (or electron beam) passes through the magnifying
     lenses. Objects such as a human hair appear smooth (and feel smooth) when viewed with the
     unaided or naked) eye. However, put a hair under a microscope and it takes on a VERY
     different look!

     Working distance is the distance between the specimen and the magnifying lens.

     Depth of field is a measure of the amount of a specimen that can be in focus.

   Magnification and resolution are terms used frequently in the study of cell biology, often
   without an accurate definition of their meanings. Magnification is a ratio of the enlargement
   (or reduction) of an image (drawing or photomicrograph), usually expressed as X1, X1/2, X430,
   X1000, etc. Resolution is the ability to distinguish between two points. Generally resolution
   increases with magnification, although there does come a point of diminishing returns where you
   increase magnification beyond added resolution gain.

   Scientists employ the metric system to measure the size and volume of specimens. The basic unit
   of length is the meter (slightly over 1 yard). Prefixes are added to the "meter" to indicate
   multiple meters (kilometer) or fractional meters (millimeter). Below are the values of some of
   the prefixes used in the metric system.

   kilo = one thousand of the basic unit

   meter = basic unit of length

   centi = one hundreth (1/100) of the basic unit

   milli = one thousandth (1/1000) of the basic unit

   micro = one millionth (1/1,000,000) of the basic unit

   nano = one billionth (1/1,000,000,000) of the basic unit

   The basic unit of length is the meter (m), and of volume it is the liter (l). The gram (g).
   Prefixes listed above can be applied to all of these basic units, abbreviated as km, kg, ml, mg,
   nm....etc. The Greek letter micron (µ) is applied to small measurements (thoud\sandths of a
   millimeter), producing the micrometer (symbolized as µm). Measurements in microscopy are usually
   expressed in the metric system. General units you will encounter in your continuing biology
   careers include micrometer (µm, 10^-6m), nanometer (nm, 10^-9m), and angstrom (Å, 10^-10m).

   Light microscopes were the first to be developed, and still the most commonly used ones. The
   best resolution of light microscopes (LM) is 0.2 µm. Magnification of LMs is generally limited
   by the properties of the glass used to make microscope lenses and the physical properties of
   their light sources. The generally accepted maximum magnifications in biological uses are
   between 1000X and 1250X. Calculation of LM magnification is done by multiplying objective value
   by eyepiece value.

   To view relatively large objects at lower magnifications we utilize the dissecting microscope
   (shown in Figure 7). Common uses of this microscope include examination of prepared microscope
   slides at low magnification, dissection (hence the name) of flowers or animal organs, and
   examinations of the surface of objects such as pennies and five dollar bills. Magnification on
   the dissecting microscope is calculated by multiplying the ocular (or eyepiece) value (usually
   10X) by the value of the objective lens (a variable between 0.7 and 3X). The value of the
   objective lens is selected using a dial on the body tube of the microscope.

   [dissecmic.gif]

   The compound light microscope, shown in Figure 8, uses two ground glass lenses to form the
   image. The lenses in this microscope, however, are aligned with the light source and specimen so
   that the light passes through the specimen, rather than reflects off the surface (as in the
   dissecting microscope shown in Figure 7). The compound microscope provides greater magnification
   (and resoultion), but only thin specimens (or thin slices of a specimen) can be viewed with this
   type of microscope.

                                            [cmpdmic.gif]

   Electron microscopes, two examples of which are shown in Fgure 9, are more rarely encountered by
   beginning biology students. However, the images gathered from these microscopes reveal a greater
   structure of the cell, so some familiarity with the strengths and weaknesses of each type is
   useful. Instead of using light as an imaging source, a high energy beam of electrons (between
   five thousand and one billion electron volts) is focused through electromagnetic lenses (instead
   of glass lenses used in the light microscope). The increased resolution results from the shorter
   wavelength of the electron beam, increasing resolution in the transmission electron microscope
   (TEM) to a theoretical limit of 0.2 nm. The magnifications reached by TEMs are commonly over
   100,000X, depending on the nature of the sample and the operating condition of the TEM. The
   other type of electron microscope is the scanning electron microscope (SEM). It uses a different
   method of electron capture and displays images on high resolution television monitors. The
   resolution and magnification of the SEM are less than that of the TEM although still orders of
   magnitude above the LM.

   from http://nsm.fullerton.edu/~skarl/EM/Equipment/TEM.html. The above right image of a scanning
   electron microscope is from http://nsm.fullerton.edu/~skarl/EM/Equipment/SEM.html.
