  Life Cycles | Back to Top

   Animal life cycles have meiosis followed immediately by gametogenesis. Gametes are produced
   directly by meiosis. Male gametes are sperm. Female gametes are eggs or ova.

   The plant life cycle has mitosis occurring in spores, produced by meiosis, that germinate into
   the gametophyte phase. Gametophyte size ranges from three cells (in pollen) to several million
   (in a "lower plant" such as moss). Alternation of generations occurs in plants, where the
   sporophyte phase is succeeded by the gametophyte phase. The sporophyte phase produces spores by
   meiosis within a sporangium. The gametophyte phase produces gametes by mitosis within an
   antheridium (producing sperm) and/or archegonium (producing eggs). Within the plant kingdom the
   dominance of phases varies. Nonvascular plants, the mosses and liverworts, have the gametophyte
   phase dominant. Vascular plants show a progression of increasing sporophyte dominance from the
   ferns and "fern allies" to angiosperms.

  Angiosperms | Back to Top

   Flowering plants, the angiosperms, were the last of the seed plant groups to evolve, appearing
   over 100 million years ago during the middle of the Age of Dinosaurs (late Jurassic). All
   flowering plants produce flowers and if they are sexually reproductive, they produce a diploid
   zygote and triploid endosperm.

   Whence came the angiosperms? This was Darwin's "abominable mystery". Clearly angiosperms are
   descended from some group of Mesozoic-aged gymnosperm seed plant....but which one? Click here to
   view an online lab exercise in phylogeny and try to figure things out!

   The classical view of flowering plant evolution suggests early angiosperms were evergreen trees
   that produced large Magnolia-like flowers. Click here to view an illustration of suggested paths
   of floral evolution.

  Flowers | Back to Top

   Flowers are collections of reproductive and sterile tissue arranged in a tight whorled array
   having very short internodes. Sterile parts of flowers are the sepals and petals. When these are
   similar in size and shape, they are termed tepals. Reproductive parts of the flower are the
   stamen (male, collectively termed the androecium) and carpel (often the carpel is referred to as
   the pistil, the female parts collectively termed the gynoecium).

    Androecium

   The individual units of the androecium are the stamens, which consist of a filament which
   supports the anther. The anther contains four microsporangia within which microspores (pollen)
   are produced by meiosis.

                                             [anther.gif]

   Stamens are thought to represent modified sporophylls (leaves with sporangia on their upper
   surface). Examinations by James E. Canright in the 1950s suggested an evolutionary series from
   primitive angiosperms (like Austrobaileya ) which have leafish stamens to others with "normal"
   stamens (Lilium).

    Pollen

   Pollen grains (from the greek palynos for dust or pollen) contain the male gametophyte
   (microgametophyte) phase of the plant. Pollen grains are produced by meiosis of microspore
   mother cells that are located along the inner edge of the anther sacs (microsporangia). The
   outer part of the pollen is the exine, which is composed of a complex polysaccharide,
   sporopollenin. Inside the pollen are two (or, at most, three) cells that comprise the male
   gametophyte. The tube cell (also referred to as the tube nucleus) develops into the pollen tube.
   The germ cell divides by mitosis to produce two sperm cells. Division of the germ cell can occur
   before or after pollination.

   pollen_grains.

    Gynoecium

   The gynoecium consists of the stigma, style, and ovary containing one or more ovules. These
   three structures are often termed a pistil or carpel. In many plants, the pistils will fuse for
   all or part of their length.

   Like the stamen, the carpel is thought to be a modified leaf. Work by I.W. Bailey and his
   students pointed to an evolutionary sequence from primitive angiosperms (like Drimys ) to
   "normal" carpels like those of Lilium..

    The Stigma and Style

   The stigma functions as a receptive surface on which pollen lands and germinates its pollen
   tube. Corn silk is part stigma, part style. The style serves to move the stigma some distance
   from the ovary. This distance is species specific.

    The Ovary

   The ovary contains one or more ovules, which in turn contain one female gametophyte, also
   referred to in angiosperms as the embryo sac. Some plants, such as cherry, have only a single
   ovary which produces two ovules. Only one ovule will develop into a seed.
