   abiogenesis  Early theory that held that some organisms originated from nonliving material.

   abnormal hemoglobin Hemoglobin molecule with a different shape due to an altered amino acid
   sequence (ultimately caused by an altered DNA base sequence), such as in the inherited disease
   sickle-cell anemia.

   abscisic acid  A plant hormone that promotes dormancy in perennial plants and causes rapid
   closure of leaf stomata when a leaf begins to wilt.

   absolute time One of the two types of geologic time (relative time being the other), with a
   definite age date established mostly by the decay of radioactive elements, although ages may
   also be obtained by counting tree rings, decay of a specific type of atom, or annual sedimentary
   layers (such as varves in lakes or layers in a glacier). The term is in some disfavor because it
   suggests an exactness that may not be possible to obtain.

   absorption  The process by which the products of digestion are transferred into the body's
   internal environment, enabling them to reach the cells.

   absorptive feeders  Animals such as tapeworms that ingest food through the body wall.

   acetylcholine  A chemical released at neuromuscular junctions that binds to receptors on the
   surface of the plasma membrane of muscle cells, causing an electrical impulse to be transmitted.
   The impulse ultimately leads to muscle contraction.

   acetyl CoA  An intermediate compound formed during the breakdown of glucose by adding a
   two-carbon fragment to a carrier molecule (Coenzyme A or CoA).

   acid  A substance that increases the number of hydrogen ions in a solution.

   acid rain  The precipitation of sulfuric acid and other acids as rain. The acids form when
   sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides released during the combustion of fossil fuels combine with
   water and oxygen in the atmosphere.

   acoelomates  Animals that do not have a coelom or body cavity; e.g., sponges and flatworms.

   acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)  A collection of disorders that develop as a result of

   concentration to regions of high concentration) with the aid of proteins in the cell membrane
   and energy from ATP. PICTURE

   adaptation Tendency of an organism to suit its environment; one of the major points of Charles
   Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection: organisms adapt to their environment. Those
   organisms best adapted will have a greater chance of surviving and passing their genes on to the
   next generation.

   adaptive radiation  The development of a variety of species from a single ancestral form; occurs
   when a new habitat becomes available to a population. Evolutionary pattern of divergence of a
   great many taxa from a common ancestral species as a result of novel adaptations or a recent
   mass extinction. Examples: mammals during the Cenozoic Era after the extinction of dinosaurs at

   phosphhate groups attached to the adenine base and ribose sugar. PICTURE

   adenosine triphosphate (ATP)  A common form in which energy is stored in living systems;
          consists of a nucleotide (with ribose sugar) with three phosphate groups. The energy coin
          of the cell. PICTURE

   produced from a single parent; occurs by many mechanisms, including fission, budding, and
   fragmentation.

   assortment  A way in which meiosis produces new combinations of genetic information. Paternal
   and maternal chromosomes line up randomly during synapsis, so each daughter cell is likely to
   receive an assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes rather than a complete set from
   either.

   centriole (if it is present). PICTURE

   asteroid impacts Hypothesis that links certain mass extinction events with the impact of a comet
   or asteroid, most notably the mass extinction 65 million years that caused the disappearance of
   dinosaurs and many other reptilian groups. Asteroid impacts early in earth history also
   contributed to the formation of the atmosphere and oceans.

   inorganic raw materials.

   autotrophs  Organisms that synthesize their own nutrients; include some bacteria that are able
   to synthesize organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds.

   auxins  A group of hormones involved in controlling plant growth and other functions; once
   thought responsible for phototropism by causing the cells on the shaded side of a plant to
   elongate, thereby causing the plant to bend toward the light.

   axial skeleton  The skull, vertebral column, and rib cage; one of the two components of the
   skeleton in vertebrates.
