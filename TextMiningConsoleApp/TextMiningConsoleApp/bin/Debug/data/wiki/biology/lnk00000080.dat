The Biosphere | Back to Top

   The biosphere is the sum of all living matter on the Earth. Highly specialized organisms have
   adapted to the extreme boundaries of the uppermost atmosphere and lowermost ocean depths. The
   biosphere is interconnected with three other spheres of the physical environment: the
   lithosphere, the hydrosphere, and the atmosphere.

   The lithosphere is the solid outer layer of the Earth's crust, including rocks, sand, and soil.
   The Earth's lithosphere is a dynamic area, with processes such as erosion, earthquakes, and
   plate tectonics (shown in Figure 1) constantly altering and forming/destroying the surface. The
   tectonic cycle describes the formation of new crust in some areas and its destruction in others.

   Plate tectonics is the geological theory that proposes the lithosphere is composed of tectonic
   plates that are in constant motion relative to each other. New oceanic crust forms at divergent
   plate boundaries, which are expressed on the Earth's surface as midocean ridges (undersea) or
   rift valleys (on land). The mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East African Rift are examples of these
   features. Old crust is subducted and remelted at convergent plate boundaries, which are
   expressed on the Earth's surface as deep ocean trenches. The Marianas Trench and other trenches
   are examples of this type of boundary. The plates essentially "float" on a semi-molten lower
   crustal layer. Plate motion rates range between 2 and 15 centimeters per year. Tectonic
   processes have formed new continents, mountain ranges, and moved existing continents across the
   surface of the Earth, causing the evolution and extinction of species from resulting climate and
   environmental changes.

   The hydrosphere includes all water at or near the Earth's surface. Water is very important to a
   number of biological and geological processes. The hydrologic cycle is the continuous recycling
   of water between the oceans and atmosphere. Evaporation is the movement of water from an ocean
   or a lake to the atmosphere. Transpiration by plants contributes to atmospheric water content.
   Precipitation (rainfall or snow) is the movement of water from the atmosphere to the land or
   ocean. Water on land can be either surface runoff or filter through soil to become groundwater.

   The atmosphere is the envelope of gas that surrounds the Earth. Nitrogen and oxygen compose 99%
   of the modern atmosphere. The atmosphere becomes progressively thinner with increasing altitude.

Connectivity of the Spheres | Back to Top

   The spheres are connected and relate to each other at a variety of interfaces. The geological
   process of volcanism transfers water from the lithosphere to the atmosphere, where it
   precipitates into the hydrosphere. The interface between water and air likewise allows transfer
   of material from one sphere to another.

Biogeochemical Cycles | Back to Top

   More than thirty chemical elements are cycled through the environment by biogeochemical cycles.
   There are six important biogeochemical cycles that transport carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
   sulfur, and phosphorous. Recall that these six elements comprise the bulk of atoms in living
   things. Carbon, the most abundant element in the human body, is not the most common element in
   the crust, silicon is.

    The Hydrologic (Water) Cycle

   Saltwater evaporates from sun's energy producing fresh water in clouds, leaving salts in the
   ocean. Water vapor cools and condenses to precipitation over oceans and land. Runoff forms
   freshwater lakes, streams, ponds, groundwater, and is held in plants and transpired. Some water
   infiltrates the ground, becoming part of the groundwater, returning very slowly to the oceans.
   Although the water cycle, Figure 2, shows water to be a renewable resource, only about 3% of
   that water is fresh and suitable for human use. Water may be polluted or inadequate for human
   populations concentrated in specific areas.

                                            [hydrocyc.gif]

   Cycling processes for other elements involve:
     * Reservoir or portion of earth that acts as storehouse for element.
     * Exchange pool or part of environment from which producers take nutrients.
     * Biotic community where elements move along food chains to and from the exchange pool.

    The Phosphorus Cycle

   Weathering of rocks makes phosphate ions (PO[4]^= and HPO[4]^=) available to plants through
   uptake from the soil. The mineral apatite contains a small amount of phosphorous, although this
   is enough for all living things to utilize. Runoff returns phosphates to aquatic systems and
   sediment. Organisms use phosphate in phospholipids, ATP, teeth, bones, and shells. Phosphate is
   a limiting nutrient because most of it is being currently used in organisms. The inorganic
   source, apatite, is a rare mineral, further limiting the input of this essential nutrient. A
   specimen of this mineral is shown in Figure 3.

   Figure 3. Apatite, the chief source of phosphate for living systems via the phosphorous cycle.

                                            [apatite.jpg]

   Humans mine phosphate ores for use in fertilizer, as an animal feed supplement, and for
   detergents. Detergents, untreated human and animal wastes, and fertilizers from cropland add
   excess phosphate to water often causing population explosions (algal blooms) in lakes. The
   phosphate cycle is shown in Figure 4.

                                            [01pcycle.gif]

    The Nitrogen Cycle

   Atmospheric nitrogen gas (N[2]), the major portion of our modern atmosphere, is unfortunately in
   a form that is bnot usable by plants and most other organisms. Plants therefore depend on
   various types of nitrogen-fixing bacteria to take up nitrogen gas and make it available to them
   as some form of organic nitrogen. Nitrogen fixation occurs when nitrogen gas is chemically
   reduced and nitrogen is added to organic compounds. Atmospheric nitrogen is converted to
   ammonium (NH[4]^+) by some cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems and by nitrogen-fixing bacteria
   in the nodules on roots of legume (beans, peas, clover, etc.) plants in terrestrial ecosystems.
   Plants take up both NH[4]^+ and nitrate (NO[3]^-) from soil. The nitrate (NO[3]^-) is
   enzymatically reduced to ammonium (NH[4]^+) and used in the production of both amino acids and
   nucleic acids. The nitrogen cycle is shown in Figure 5.

   Figure 5. The nitrogen cycle. Image from http://bioweb.wku.edu/faculty/ameier/nitrogencycle.GIF.

                                        [01nitrogencycle.GIF]

   Nitrification is the inorganic production of nitrates. Nitrogen gas (N[2]) is converted to
   nitrate (NO[3]^-) by cosmic radiation, meteor trails, and lightning in the atmosphere. Human
   technology can now manufacture nitrates for use in fertilizers. In soil, bacteria convert
   ammonium (NH[4]^+) to nitrate (NO[3]^-) by a two-step process shown in Figure 6.
   Nitrite-producing bacteria convert ammonia to nitrite (NO[2]^-). Next, nitrate-producing
   bacteria convert nitrite to nitrate. These two groups of bacteria are called nitrifying
   bacteria.

   Denitrification is conversion of nitrate to nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas back to atmosphere.
   This is done by denitrifying bacteria in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The process of
   denitrification almost, but not completely, counterbalances nitrogen fixation.

   Figure 6. Development of a root nodule, a place in the roots of certain plants, most notably
   legumes (the pea family), where bacteria live symbiotically with the plant. This is one route by
   which inorganic nitrogen (N[2]) is converted into organic nitrogen that can then be used by
   other organisms. Images from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by

    The Carbon Cycle

   There is a relationship between the two major metabolic processes of photosynthesis and cellular
   respiration. Cellular respiration releases carbon dioxide, which is used as a raw material in
   photosynthesis. Photosynthesis in turn releases oxygen used in respiration. Animals and other
   heterotrophs depend on green organisms for organic food, energy, and oxygen. In the carbon
   cycle, organisms exchange carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. On land, plants take up carbon
   dioxide via photosynthesis and incorporate it into food used by themselves and heterotrophs.
   When organisms respire, some of this carbon is returned to the atmosphere in the molecules of
   carbon dioxide. In aquatic ecosystems, carbon dioxide from air combines with water to give
   carbonic acid, which breaks down to bicarbonate ions. Bicarbonate ions are a source of carbon
   for algae. When aquatic organisms respire, they release carbon dioxide that becomes bicarbonate
   (HCO[3]). The amount of bicarbonate in water is in equilibrium with amount of carbon dioxide in
   air.

   Living and dead organisms are reservoirs of carbon in carbon cycle, shown in Figure 7. More than
   800 billion tons of carbon are in the world's biota, mainly in cells of trees. An additional
   1,000 to 3,000 billion tons of carbon occurs in plant and animal remains in the soil. Fossil
   fuels, such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas, were formed during various times of the
   geologic past when exceptional amount of organic matter were rapidly buried in an environment
   that locally lacked biologic activity. Inorganic calcium carbonate (the minerals calcite and
   aragonite, CaCO[3]) accumulates in limestone and the calcite of shells.

   Human burning of fossil fuels and wood has increased the amount of carbon dioxide released into
   atmosphere to 42 billion metric tons in only 22 years. Since human activity in 22 years probably
   released 78 billion metric tons, 36 billion metric tons were probably absorbed in oceans.
   Increased carbon dioxide levels may increase the greenhouse effect, where such gases allow the
   Sun's radiant energy to pass through to Earth where it is absorbed and reradiated as heat.
   Instead of radiating fromthe earth back into space, this heat is then trapped on Earth, perhaps
   causing or contributing to global warming.

   http://www.igpp.lanl.gov/Climate_Images/Climate14.gif.

                                            [1Ccycle.gif]

   Excess output occurs when biomass is suddenly released, such as in slash and burn agriculture.
   Excess input commonly occurs from agricultural increase in organic fertilizer and other
   nutrients into an ecosystem. Generally speaking, the faster matter cycles, the faster it can
   recover from human intervention.

   Recently, speculation has centered on the interconnection of biogeochemical cycles and their
   possible roles in a "superorganism" that James Lovelock has called Gaia, after the ancient Greek
   Earth goddess. While an intriguing notion, the degree of organization of these cycles is not as
   complex or integrated as the cells in a body. Gaia remains controversial hypothesis that
   continues to generate speculation and research both pro and con.

Disruption of the Biosphere | Back to Top

   Human technology and population growth can directly and indirectly disturb the biosphere. They
   key question now is: can humans cause global climate change? The human population has
   experienced phenomenal exponential growth since the Industrial Revolution. Modern agriculture
   and medicine have increased growth rates for our population, resulting in over 90 million people
   added each year. United Nations estimates indicate a human population of 10 billion may exist by
   the end of the twenty-first century.

   Human populations are in a growth phase, shown in Figure 8. Since evolving around 200,000 years
   ago, our species has proliferated and spread over the Earth. Beginning in 1650, the slow
   population increases of our species exponentially increased. New technologies for hunting and
   farming have facilitated this expansion. It took 1800 years to reach a total population of 1
   billion, but only 130 years to reach 2 billion, and a mere 45 years to reach 4 billion.

   disease (the Black Death) and technological advances on the population size. Images from Purves

    Two Classes of Countries

   The developed countries are those that industrialized first, such as the United States, Canada,
   Japan, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, and all of Europe. These countries have twenty-two
   percent of the world's population, but consume nearly eighty percent of the energy and
   resources. Waste and pollution are also greater in proportion to use of resources.

   The developing countries have seventy-eight percent of the population, but use only twenty
   percent of the Earth's resources. These countries include most of Africa, South America, India,
   and China. Most people in these coluntries have a lifestyle far below that of the inhabitants of
   the developed countries. As developing contries expand their economies, their people will strive
   to achieve the lifestyle of consumption and waste that we in developed countries take for
   granted. For instance, in China the bicycle remains the method of transportation for most
   people, but more and more motorcycles and cars are owned by the increasing affluent entrepenuers
   and government officials. When I visited the faculty and students at Wuyi University (China) in
   1998, only a few of the faculty had motor bikes. A colleague of mine visited the same university
   in the summer of 2002 and reported that almost all faculty had motor bikes.

   Industrialization is driven by energy consumption from coal, petroleum, and natural gas,
   otherwise known as fossil fuels. Fossil fuels formed by decomposition and alteration of the
   remains of plants, protists, and animals over a time span of several million years. These
   sources are considered nonrenewable since they are in limited supply in terms of human-scale
   time. Oil (petroleum) is the fuel most widely used, both as starting material for making
   gasoline and for other products. Historically coal was the first fossil fuel used in the
   European/American Industrial Revolution of the 1800s. Petroleum soon replaced coal, and has
   remained the mainstay of the energy fix needed by industrialized societies.

   Pollution is any environmental change that adversely affects the lives and health of living
   things. Burning fossil fuels results in hydrocarbons, carbon, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, and
   particulates. Automobiles consume one-third of the world's production of oil and are the chief
   source of air pollution. Some scientists estimate there will be four times more automobiles in
   the world by 2025. Industrially produced halogens and the use of nitrogen fertilizers also
   influence the atmosphere in a negative manner.

   Sources of energy that are relatively nonpolluting exist. However, these nonpolluting energy
   sources are not as commonly used as fossil fuels. Solar energy does not add additional heat to
   the atmosphere, although the production of solar panels may contribute to pollution. Solar
   panels, often mounted on rooftops, absorb and move rooftop heat into water circulating within
   the panels. Photovoltaic (solar) cells produce energy directly from sunlight, although the cost
   of this energy is several times what conventional (fossil) fuel-generated electricity costs.

   Falling water is used to produce electricity in hydroelectric dams, asshown in Figure 9.
   However, most dams would not be compliant with newer, more strict environmental regulations. The
   damming of rivers to generate power (and hold water for irrigation and other purposes) can lead
   to local extinctions or declines in native fish populations. Water that id dammed up no longer
   freely flows, placing wetland habitats downstream from the dam at risk. The numerous dams built
   along the Salt and Verde Rivers in Phoenx, Arizona (USA) have led to a reduction of downstream
   biodiversity as once perenniel streams now flow only seasonally. Construction of the Glen Canyon
   Dam on the Colorado River in northern Arizona (shown in Figure 10) has led to vegetaion and
   other changes inside Grand Canyon Nartional Park. The Three Gorges Dam being currently built
   along the banks of the Yangtze River in China will displace over two million people, flood areas
   that have been inhabited for over 10,000 years, as well as disrupt the breeding patterns of the
   Yangtze sturgeon. When complete, this dam will generate enough power every day to light a city
   the size of Los Angeles, adding new power to the Chinese economic expansion.

                                  [01glencnyn.jpg] [01turbines.jpg]

   Geothermal energy is derived from heat in the earth's core heats water to heat buildings and
   generate electricity. This source of energy is usually not located near enough to population
   centers to be economically feasible to exploit. One notable exception is in Iceland, which sits
   astride the midAtlantic Ridge, where the capitol city is heated exclusively by geothermal power.

   Wind power can pump water or generate electricity. Windmills have for long times been used for
   water pumping or t he grinding of corn or other grains. One problem with wind power is that in
   most p;aces the winds do not blow at the same velocity all year round, and the power generated
   when the wind does blow is not effectively stored in batteries. That aside, there are several
   places in Oklahoma and california where wind power is cost-effective.

   Solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power are all considered renewable sources of energy since
   they are replenished by physical means. However, none of them have replaced fossil fuel in
   widespread use in the industrialized countries. Generally, European countries make better use of
   these forms of energy than does the United States.

    Atmospheric Pollution

   The one percent of the atmosphere (trace gases) that is neither nitrogen or oxygen, plays an
   important role in global climate and in shielding the Earth's surface from solar radiation.
   Agricultural and industrial gases may affect the atmosphere's ability to protect as well as
   alter the world's climate.

   Carbon dioxide has many sources (cellular respiration, and the burning of wood or fossil fuels
   such as coal or petroleum). There are two main sinks for carbon dioxide: plants and the oceans.
   Plants convert carbon dioxide into organic molecules by photosynthesis. Oceans form calcium
   carbonate and over long periods of time, store it as limestone. Since the Industrial Revolution,
   carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased. This increase has rapidly accelerated
   during the past forty years. Both trends are shown in Figure 11.

   Figure 11. Top image: Increase in carbon dioxide levels between 1960 and 1990. Image from Purves

   [carbon.gif]

   Carbon dioxide and other gases allow light to pass, but trap reradiated heat from the Earth in
   the atmosphere much like glass in a greenhouse traps heat. Increased carbon dioxide levels lead
   to more and more heat trapped. This greenhouse effect is thought to be responsible for global
   warming, a phenomenon that has been going on for the past 10,000 years (Figure 12), but which
   seems to have accelerated during the past 150 years. Carbon dioxide is not the only gas that can
   cause a greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide contributes to only 56% of greenhouse heating. Methane
   (CH[4]) is expelled in great quantities by cows, and as cattle production has increased so has
   their methane production (at a rate of about 1% per year).

    Temperatures, Greenhouses, and Climate Changes

   The average temperature of the Earth has risen by 0.5 degrees C over the past one hundred years.
   Although a long-term rise of two degrees would seem minor, this is thought sufficient to
   completely melt the glacial ice caps in Antarctica and Greenland, causing global sea-levels to
   rise 100 meters. This can alter climate patterns such as rainfall, ocean currents, and climate
   zones. Climate changes can have biological (such as causing migrations) as well as geopolitical
   and economic consequences.

   Earth's climate fluctuates on both short-term and long-term time scales. There have been periods
   of Earth history with higher average annual temperatures than we have today, as well as the
   reverse condition, when glaciers covered extensive expanses of the Northern and/or Southern
   hemispheres. We are currently between ice ages, the last of which ended nearly 10,000 years ago.
   Climate fluctuations have left evidence in the distribution of fossils, living forms and their
   close relatives, and locations of certain types of sedimentary rocks. Studies of fossils and the
   sedimentary rocks they occur in have led to estimates of temperature. Paleoecology is the branch
   of science that deals with such data in an attempt to reconstruct the evironments of the distant
   (and not so distant) past.

   periods (interglacials). Image courtesy of Prof. Dennis L. Hartmann, Department of Atmospheric

                                            [CO2conc.gif]

   Some scientists are concerned that global climate will warm at a rate ten times faster than it
   has in the past. Composition of the minor components of the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide,
   provide clues about thepossible rapidity of climatic changes. In 1850, atmospheric carbon
   dioxide was approximately 280 parts per million (ppm). Today, it is about 350 ppm. This increase
   is due largely to burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests. Oceans (and photosynthetic
   organisms) currently absorb half of the carbon dioxide emitted. Methane is another atmospheric
   pollutant produced by by oil and gas wells, rice paddies, cows, etc. This gas is increasing by
   one percent per year.

   The greenhouse effect, shown in Figure 13, is a warming of the lower atmosphere caused by
   accumulation of certain greenhouse gases (notably carbon dioxide and methane) that allow rays of
   the sun to pass through, but then reflect or reradiate heat to the Earth. In this way heat is
   trapped on Earth much the same way heat is trapped behind the glass panels of a greenhouse.

   Greenhouse gases include a diverse variety of atmospheric gases, as shown in Figure 14. Carbon
   dioxide is a product of burning fossil fuel and wood. Nitrous oxide (NO[2]), produced by
   fertilizer use and released from decomposition of animal wastes is another prominent greenhouse
   gas. Methane (CH[4]) is produced by bacteria (especially in animal intestines), sediments,
   swamps, certain types of landfills, and in flooded rice paddies. In some cases methane can be
   collected and used to generate a small amount of electricity. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), in
   particular Freon (a refrigerant) are greenhouse gases thought responsible to depletion of the
   planetary ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. Halons, such as halocarbons; C[x]F[x]Br[x]), are
   released from fire extinguishers. Water vapor is a greenhouse gas since clouds reradiate heat
   back to Earth.

   the vertical scale changes to parts per billion (ppb) for the nitrogen oxides and the CFC-11
   graphs. The CFC graph begins in the 1950s since this type of pollutant did not exist before that
   date. Images from Images of Biology (out of print).

                                          [greenhousgs.gif]

   Analysis of gas trapped in Arctic ice (and glaciers in other parts of the world) shows earth's
   temperature fluctuated in the past, according to the levels of carbon dioxide and methane.

   Greenhouse gases differ in their ability to absorb specific wavelengths of infrared radiation.
   The heat retention capacity of methane is about 25 times greater than that of carbon dioxide.
   Nitrous oxide is about 200 times more effective than carbon dioxide. The global climate appears
   to have risen about 0.5 C since the Industrial Revolution. With that revolution came an increase
   in the use of fossil fuels, as well as production of certain greenhouse gases that were
   extremely rare before industrialization. Some computer models predict a rise of from 1.5 degrees
   C to 4.5 degrees C by 2060.

   The ecological effects of such a sudden rise in global temperature would be noticeable. From
   studies of fossils we can estimate how long it would naturally take for such rises in
   temerature. The effects of human activity on the atmosphere will accelerate this rise from a
   span of centuries to just a few decades. As oceans warm, temperatures in polar regions would
   likely rise to a greater degree than other areas. Glaciers would melt and sea levels would rise
   due to melting and expansion of warm water. Water evaporation would increase with increased
   rainfall along coasts and dry conditions inland. Droughts would reduce agricultural productivity
   and trees would die off. Expansion of forests into Arctic areas would not likely offset loss of
   forests in temperate zones. Coastal agricultural lands and deltas in Bangladesh, India, and
   China would be inundated. In China two-thirds of the 1.2 billion people live in low-lying
   coastal areas. Many of these areas would be flooded by rising sea levels.

    The Ozone Layer

   Earth's atmosphere conswists of a number of different layers. The troposphere is the lower
   atmospheric layer. It surrounds us at ground level. The stratosphere is often referred to as the
   upper atmosphere. The stratosphere contains the ozone shield, a layer of ozone (O[3]) in the
   stratosphere, 50 km above the ground. Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when sunlight
   strikes oxygen atoms and causes them to temporarily combine. Stratospheric ozone helps filter
   most of the high-energy ultraviolet radiation that causes cancer and mutations. The development
   of atmospheric ozone shield is one of the necessary events in the history of life that permitted
   life to exist on land. Aquatic organisms, including all known early life forms, are shielded by
   water. Known hazards of UV radiation include increased mutation rate, which can lead to skin
   cancer and cataracts, depression of the immune system, impaired crop and tree growth, and the
   death of plankton. Each 1% drop in ozone is thought to increase human skin cancer rates by 4-6%.
   The United Nations Environment Program predicts a 26 percent rise in cataracts and nonmelanoma
   skin cancers for every 10% drop in ozone. This translates to 1.75 million cases of cataracts and
   300,000 more cases of skin cancer every year. The incidences of certain skin cancers is shown in
   Figure 15.

   the United States during July 1992. Image modified by M.J. Farabee from data obtained from NASA.

                                             [cancer.gif]

   During the 1980s scientists discovered a "hole" in the ozone over Antarctica, and that some
   depletion of worldwide ozone had taken place. By the 1990s atmospheric scientists had detected
   an annual loss of 40-50% of the ozone above Antarctica, which produced an ozone hole every
   spring. The development of ozone holes depends on complex atmospheric conditions.

   Ozone is being destroyed by the release of gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), containing
   chlorine (Cl^-) atoms in the stratosphere. CFCs are used in refrigerators, air conditioners, and
   solvents. Chlorine atoms come from breakdown of CFCs, which were in heavy human use from 1950 to
   1990. One CFC molecule can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules. International agreements were
   developed to phase out the use of CFCs by the year 2000. However, since it takes 20-30 years for
   CFCs to rise to the upper atmosphere, and another 100 years for their destruction, ozone
   destruction will continue for some time to come.

    Acid Deposition

   Humans also alter their local atmosphere by pollution and acid rain. Burning of fossil fuels
   releases carbon dioxide and nitrogen and sulfur oxides. Sulfur combines with atmospheric water
   vapor to form sulfuric acid. Forests and lakes suffer from the pH and soil acidity changes
   resulting from acid rain. Changes in the pH of precipitation between 1955 and 1980 are shown in
   Figure 16.

   Pure water has a pH of 7, neutral on the pH scale. In such a solurtion, the dissociation of
   H[2]O produces equal numbers of H^+ and OH^- ions. Atmospheric CO[2] combines with water to
   produce a weak carbonic acid (H[2]CO[3]) and an increased number of H^+ ions. Rainwater normally
   has a pH of 5.6 rather than 7.0. However, near industrialized or urban areas, rainfall pH is
   nearer 4.0 and some fog clouds drop to a pH as acidic as 1.7. Living vegetation and limestone
   used for monuments and buildings rapidly deteriorate under such "acid rains."

   Coal and oil routinely burned by power plants emit sulfur dioxide (SO[2]) into the air. Oil from
   Kuwait has a naturally high sulfur content. Oil well fires, some set on purpose during the Gulf
   War of the early 1990s, released much sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. Most of the
   commercially exploitable coals in the US have high sulfur content. Automobile exhaust
   contributes nitrogen oxides to the air. Both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are converted to
   acids when they combine with water vapor in the air. Sulfur and nitrogen oxides are emitted in
   one locale while deposition occurs in another location across boundaries.

   Acid deposition is responsible for the following:
     * sterilization of North American and European lakes and forests;
     * reducing the populations of small invertebrates and decomposers, threatening the ecosystem;
     * reducing agricultural yields;
     * causing extensive structural damage by corroding marble, metal, and stonework;
     * degrading water supplies by leaching heavy metals from the soil into drinking-water
       supplies; and
     * statistically is implicated in increases in lung cancer and colon cancer.

    Smog

   Smog is an urban problem caused by combustion of fuels. Pollutants react with sunlight to cause
   more than 100 secondary pollutants that can cause respiratory problems (asthma and such) in
   humans. Most problems with acid rain and smog are caused by the use of fossil fuels. The U.S.
   gets 90% of its energy from fossil fuels, more than half of which is wasted. Conservation
   measures, more fuel efficient vehicles, mass transit, and alternative energy sources are
   possible measures to be taken. World supplies of petroleum are estimated to run out in 50-100
   years.

   Photochemical smog is air pollution that contains nitrogen oxides (NO[x]) [where the x is a 2 or
   3] and hydrocarbons (HC), that react together in the presence of sunlight to produce ozone
   (O[3]) and peroxylacetyl nitrate (PAN). Both NO[x] and hydrocarbons result from the burning (or
   combustion) of fossil fuel. Additional hydrocarbons come from various other sources as well,
   including paint solvents and pesticides.

   Breathing O[3] affects both the respiratory and nervous systems, resulting in respiratory
   distress, headache, and exhaustion. Ozone is damaging to plants, resulting in leaf mottling and
   reduced growth.

   Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that comes from burning of fossil fuels in the industrial regions.
   High levels of CO increase the formation of ozone (O[3]). CO combines preferentially with
   hemoglobin and prevents hemoglobin from carrying oxygen. The amount of CO over the Southern
   Hemisphere, produced by the burning of tropical forests, is equal to that over the Northern
   Hemisphere, produced by industrial activity..

   Thermal inversions are local occurrences of polluted air being trapped close to the surface.
   This is a major problem in cities located in a valley, like the Phoenix (Arizona) metropolitan
   area. Warm air near the ground usually rises and dissipates into the upper atmosphere. Air
   pollutants, including smog and soot, can be trapped near ground due to a thermal inversion. A
   thermal inversion occurs when a layer of dense cold air is trapped under a layer of warm air.
   Areas around hills are susceptible because air stagnates, with little mixing. At certain times
   of the year, usually in winter, thermal inversions in Phoenix can cause difficulty in breating
   for some individuals who has asthma and other respiratory diseases.

    Water Pollution Is Altering the Hydrosphere

   Air pollutants will eventually precipitate into the hydrosphere. During cooler periods, ice acts
   as a water reservoir, forming glaciers that lower sea-level and affect climate. Global warming
   will melt this reservoir, raising sea level (or sinking coastlines). The hydrosphere can be
   directly altered by water polluted by human wastes. There are three basic sources of water
   pollutants: municipal sewage, industrial discharges, and agriculture/mining/logging discharges
   of sediment.

   Freshwater is required for domestic purposes, including drinking, crop irrigation, industrial
   use, and energy production. Freshwater resources include surface water from lakes and rivers,
   and underground aquifers. Pollution contributes to the shortage of freshwater. Solid wastes
   include household trash, sewage sludge, agricultural residue, mining refuse, and industrial
   waste. Pollution comes from either a point source, an identifiable source of the pollution, or a
   nonpoint source, a broad area of pollution with no single idetifiable source, such as runoff.
   The United States spends more than $9 billion a year on cleanup (including the Superfund)
   compared to a mere $200 million per year to prevent pollution. Recycling may save industry
   money, extend the life of increasingly scarce resources, and prevent or lessen pollution.

   Sewage treatment plants degrade organic wastes, which would otherwise cause oxygen depletion in
   lakes. Human feces contain pathogens (viruses, bacteria) that cause cholera, typhoid fever, and
   dysentery. Sewage treatment plants use bacteria to break down organic matter into inorganic
   nutrients. The treated water can then be used for various purposes, depending on state and local
   laws governing sewage treated water. During the spring of 2000, Los Angeles made national news
   because of the city's plans to reintroduce treated sewage water to the home water supply.

   Agricultural and industrial wastes present a number of water pollution problems. Intensive
   animal farming or the presence of many septic tanks releases ammonium (NH[4]^+) from wastes.
   This ammonium is converted by bacteria to soluble nitrate that moves through the soil to water
   supplies. Between 5-10% of all wells in the United States have nitrate levels higher than the
   recommended maximum. Industrial wastes include heavy metals and organochlorides, such as some
   pesticides. These are not degraded in nature or in normal sewage treatment, and accumulate in
   deltas. When these wastes enter water, they are subject to biological magnification. Decomposers
   are unable to break down these wastes, and they are not excreted. The molecules, therefore,
   remain in tissues and are passed up the food chain to the next consumer. They become more
   concentrated at each level in the food chain. Since aquatic food chains have more links,
   biological magnification is greater. Where humans are the final consumers, human milk can
   contain detectable amounts of DDT and PCBs.

   Aquifer pollution is an increasingly significant health threat. Prior to environmental
   regulations enacted during the 1970s, many industries ran wastewater into a pit from which
   pollutants could seep into the ground Much of this material eventually made its way to the
   groundwater in various aquifers below the surface. Wastewater and chemical wastes were also
   injected into deep wells. Both practices are being phased out; there are few alternatives for
   industry to dispose of wastes, other than to reduce the volume or develop a long-term
   containment facility.

   The oceans are the final recipients of wastes deposited in rivers and along the coasts. Waste
   dumping occurs at sea, and ocean currents sometimes transport both trash and pollutants back to
   shore. Solid pollutants cause death of birds, fish, and marine mammals that mistake them for
   food and get entangled. Offshore mining and shipping add pollutants to the oceans. Five million
   metric tons of oil a year, over one gram per 100 square meters of ocean surface, ends up in
   oceans. Large oil spills kill plankton, fish larvae, and shellfishes, as well as birds and
   marine mammals. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound leaked 44 million
   liters of crude oil. During the Gulf War, 120 million liters were released from damaged onshore
   storage tanks in the Persian Gulf. Petroleum is biodegradable; takes a long time because
   low-nutrient content does not support bacteria. Some species of fish are in dramatic decline
   from combined effects of pollution and overfishing.

    Desertification and Deforestation

   In 1950, 20 % of the world's population lived in cities. Predictions of this number rising to
   60% by 2000 have been made. The trend of growth of urban areas began with the Industrial
   revolution of the 1800s, but greatly accelerated after World War II. Buidling new housing around
   new (or enlarging) cities, removes land from agricultural uses. Change of land use can alter
   heat distribution patterns and surface water runoff. Expanded urbanization also degrades the
   environment. Estrella Mountain Commmunity College, my college, was built in 1991 (opened in
   1992) in an old cotton field. When we opened our campus the nearest houses were over one mile
   away. New houses and development are now surrounding our once isolated campus shown in Figure
   17.

   Figure 17. Estrella Mountain Community College as it appeared in May 1996. The section of land
   on the eastern border of the photograph (right side) is currently (6/2001) being developed into
   tract houses. Image from the USGS terrabyte server, http://terraserver.microsoft.com.

                                              [EMCC.gif]

   In agricultural areas, wind and rain carry away about 25 billion tons of top soil yearly,
   worldwide. At such a rate, it is estimated that practically all top soil will be lost by the
   middle of the next century. Soil erosion causes a loss of productivity; it is compensated for by
   fertilizers, pesticides, and fossil fuel energy. One solution is to employ strip-cropping and
   contour farming to control soil erosion. Desertification is transformation of marginal lands to
   desert conditions due to overgrazing and overfarming. This is most evident along the southern
   edge of the Sahara Desert in Africa. Over 240,000 square miles of once-productive grazing land
   has become desert in the last fifty years. A similar process can occur if U.S. rangeland is
   overgrazed. The Dust Bowl, shown in Figure 18, was an area of the southern Great Plains that
   experienced several years of drought, coupled with poor farming techniques and economic hard
   times. Was the area becoming a desert before soil conservation and improved farming methods
   halted the trend?

                                             [dust1.gif]

   Canada has seen immense stands of trees cut down for paper, wood products and particleboard.
   Tropical rain forests are more biologically diverse than temperate forests. U.S. temperate
   forests contain about 400 species of trees; a typical 10-hectare rain forest contains 750
   species. The loss of U.S. forests is shown in Figure 19. South American streams contain about
   twice the species found in all of the U.S. and Canada. A N.A.S. study estimates a million
   species are in danger of disappearing in 20 years due to deforestation. Lost species that have
   never been studied may have been sources of food or medicine. Logging in tropical forests meets
   the demand for furniture and also the desire of local people to farm the land. Slash-and-burn
   agriculture also contributes to the destruction of tropical rain forests. The ashes provide
   temporary nutrients to raise crops. After a few years, the fertility of the land is insufficient
   to raise crops and farmers move on. Cattle ranching usually takes over from farming. Pig-iron
   industry in Brazil also requires wood charcoal to smelt the pig iron.

Mass Extinctions | Back to Top

   Extinctions occur when environments change too fast. Local extinctions can occur, as can mass
   extinctions: they differ in scale, scope and the numbers of species involved. There have been
   five environmental changes (mostly cooling) of global proportions that resulted in the five mass
   extinctions in Earth history. Recovery from these extinctions took millions of years. A
   spectacular exception was the large meteorite strike sixty-six million years ago near the
   Yucatán peninsula in Mexico that either caused the extinction of dinosaurs and 75% of all marine
   species, or was the nail in the coffin of the dinosaurs.

   There have been several natural mass extinctions in the history of earth followed by recovery.
   Human activities that reduce biodiversity began about 30,000 years ago with development of
   social and language skills to apply increasingly better stone tool technology to trap and kill
   the largher animals. Hunting contributes to the estimated extinction of 15,000 to 30,000 species
   a year. Fish stocks are being depleted by overfishing. Commercial trade causes exploitation of
   tigers, cheetahs, leopards, jaguars, etc. for furs; sharks for fins; rhinoceros for rhino horn
   powder; elephants for tusks for ivory; and cacti for gardeners.

   A major cause of extinction is the loss of habitat to support a species. The habitat for a
   species may be totally destroyed through natural events or human activities. Habitats may be
   fragmented into small pieces that cannot support the population. By 2010, very little
   undisturbed rain forest will exist outside of national parks.

   Accidental or purposeful introduction of new species can cause extinction of endemic species.
   Introduction of brown tree snake to Guam has resulted in extinction of nine of eleven native
   bird species. The carp, an Asian fish that can tolerate polluted waters, is now more prevalent
   than our native fish. Kudzu, a plant native to Asia, has beome a major pest throughout the
   south. Water hyacinth escaped from captivity and has become a hazard to navigation, as well as
   disrupting the local environment.

   Global climate change may be so rapid that many species cannot adjust. Biological magnification
   of pesticides has reduced predatory bird populations. Acid deposition is implicated in the
   worldwide decline in amphibian populations.

   Conservation biology is a discipline that brings together many fields to attempt to solve
   biodiversity problems. It attempts to develop practical approaches to preventing extinction of
   species and destruction of ecosystems. Most conservation biologists believe biological diversity
   is good and each species has a value all its own. Sustainability is concept that it is possible
   to meet economic needs while protecting environment. Some economists argue that as per capita
   income increases, environmental degradation first increases, then decreases as people become
   affluent enough to begin to protect the environment.

    Development in Tropical Regions

   Human-caused environmental changes and extinctions are accelerating in the tropics. If this pace
   continues nearly half all species could be extinct by 2050. Development in tropical areas causes
   more extinctions due to the great diversity found in tropical rain forests (half all species on
   Earth). Tropical reefs are also under siege by water pollution, leading to even more
   extinctions. Nearly half the rain forests are gone already. By as early as 2010 (less than 15
   years!) all rain forests will be gone if present trends of exploitation and human population
   growth continue.

   Species are not equally likely to suffer extinction. Cockroaches hav e been around for 300
   million years essentially unchanged and probably will be around for millions more. Island
   species, species with limited habitats, low reproductive rates, high territory requirements,
   susceptibility to pollution, predators, and having economic value: all make species susceptible
   to extinction.

    What Does Extinction Mean to Me?

   We migh ask ourselves, why should we try to save species from extinction? One answer is that
   wildlife is a curiosity for which humans have no need. Others seek to preserve nature for its
   own sake. There are some economic reasons to save species from extinction: food and non-food
   uses.

   Approximately 7000 plant species have historically been used by humans as food. Today, thirty of
   these species provide 95% of all human food. Just four -wheat, corn, rice, and potatoes- provide
   most of the world's food. Nearly 75,000 edible plants species exist, many superior in nutrition
   and quality to the 30 we favor today. Low genetic diversity, resulting from centuries of
   selective inbreeding, make crops especially susceptible to pests and parasites. During the 1970s
   the U.S. corn crop was almost completely wiped out by a leaf fungus. The corn crop was saved by
   interbreeding it with a rare species of wild corn from Mexico. Genetic engineering may also
   offer some hope by facilitating transfer of genes between species. This increases the value of
   wild strains which can be used as sources for new traits to be introduced into crops.

   At current rates, 25,000 plant species will become extinct by the year 2000, before we have a
   chance to study them. Gene banks to save seeds, spores and genetic material have been proposed
   as a solution. Currently they contain only a small fraction of all wild plant species.
   Hybridization is also a potential method to improve domesticated animal stocks.

   Many wild plants species provide economically important products, such as rubber. Originally
   many modern medicines started out as plants used by premodern societies, such as aspirin.
   Forty-seven major drugs have been produced from flowering plants taken from the rain forests. An
   estimated 320 valuable drugs remain undiscovered in the forests Taxol, an extract from the rare
   Pacific yew tree (Taxus), is a potent anticancer drug. Some products, like oils, exotic fruits,
   and rubber are known as forest-sustainable resources since the forest does not have to be cut
   down to harvest them, and in most cases bring in more money than the wood from the trees is
   worth.

    Ecosystems as Environmental Support Systems

   Species diversity is important to preserve because ecosystems are composed of species and
   provide us with so many of life's essentials, dismantle them and we have a real big problem:
     * Oxygen to breathe (for use in aerobic respiration.
     * Medicines (to augment the body's own immune defenses)
     * Food (which we as heterotrophic consumers in the food pyramid need).
     * Drinkable water (purified by microbial activity)

How to Reduce Species Extinction and Destruction of the Biosphere | Back to Top

   Conferences in 1992 and 1994 resulted in binding international treaties to control management of
   finite resources and population growth along with the resulting human impact on the biosphere.

    Identification, Description, and Research on Value of Species

   One of the first steps is to measure how much biodiversity there is. Diversity can be measured
   at different levels: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity. Only 1.7
   million species have been described, estimates place the total number of species at 100,000,000.
   Biologist E.O. Wilson has estimated that it would take the life's work on 25,000 specialists to
   completely study and describe the mostly undescribed tropical species. There are currently only
   1500 specialists in tropical biology.

    Establishment of Preserves

   It is essential to preserve the habitat of endangered species. Once a species habitat has been
   destroyed, it is difficult to successfully reestablish the species; no ecosystem has ever been
   completely rebuilt. Preserves are well established in Africa, Asia, and the developed countries,
   although they are not well established in Central and South America. Only 1% of the Earth's land
   surface has been set aside as preserves.

    Development of Laws and Regulations to Protect Endangered Species

   Poachers are difficult to catch and punish, especially in under developed countries. In 1975 a
   treaty made it illegal to trade or sell products from endangered species. The 1989 ban on sale
   of elephant ivory has been successful in slowing the decline in elephant populations.

    The Endangered Species Act

   Nearly 4000 species in the U.S. are in danger of extinction by the year 2000. The Endangered
   Species Act of 1973 directs governmental agencies to maintain a list of threatened or endangered
   species. The Act has been controversial and was recently challenged by the Republican's Contract
   with America. The spotted owl became a major issue in the 1992 Presidential election. Most
   species on the list are closer to extinction now than when they were put on the list.

    Captive Breeding

   One last resort is to establish breeding programs in captivity. Many species do not do well in
   such programs, so alternatives like gene banks must be tried. Breeding programs are costly and
   the young from such programs cannot be released into the wild, even if their habitat still
   remains.

    Reduction of the Socioeconomic Causes of Extinction

   Basic social and economic issues that drive explosive population growth and increased
   exploitation of natural areas must be addressed. Estimate predict a doubling of the 5.4 billion
   human population by 2050, most of that growth is expected in developing countries. Slowing such
   growth will take decades at best. Removing economic incentives that cause many species
   extinctions is a more immediate measure.
