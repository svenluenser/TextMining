   The nervous system coordinates rapid and precise responses to stimuli using action potentials.
   The endocrine system maintains homeostasis and long-term control using chemical signals. The
   endocrine system works in parallel with the nervous system to control growth and maturation
   along with homeostasis.

  Hormones | Back to Top

   The endocrine system is a collection of glands that secrete chemical messages we call hormones.
   These signals are passed through the blood to arrive at a target organ, which has cells
   possessing the appropriate receptor. Exocrine glands (not part of the endocrine system) secrete
   products that are passed outside the body. Sweat glands, salivary glands, and digestive glands
   are examples of exocrine glands.

   Hormones are grouped into three classes based on their structure:
    1. steroids
    2. peptides
    3. amines

    Steroids

   Steroids are lipids derived from cholesterol. Testosterone is the male sex hormone. Estradiol,
   similar in structure to testosterone, is responsible for many female sex characteristics.
   Steroid hormones are secreted by the gonads, adrenal cortex, and placenta.

    Peptides and Amines

   Peptides are short chains of amino acids; most hormones are peptides. They are secreted by the
   pituitary, parathyroid, heart, stomach, liver, and kidneys. Amines are derived from the amino
   acid tyrosine and are secreted from the thyroid and the adrenal medulla. Solubility of the
   various hormone classes varies.

    Synthesis, Storage, and Secretion

   Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol by a biochemical reaction series. Defects along
   this series often lead to hormonal imbalances with serious consequences. Once synthesized,
   steroid hormones pass into the bloodstream; they are not stored by cells, and the rate of
   synthesis controls them.

   Peptide hormones are synthesized as precursor molecules and processed by the endoplasmic
   reticulum and Golgi where they are stored in secretory granules. When needed, the granules are
   dumped into the bloodstream. Different hormones can often be made from the same precursor
   molecule by cleaving it with a different enzyme.

   Amine hormones (notably epinephrine) are stored as granules in the cytoplasm until needed.

  Evolution of Endocrine Systems | Back to Top

   Most animals with well-developed nervous and circulatory systems have an endocrine system. Most
   of the similarities among the endocrine systems of crustaceans, arthropods, and vertebrates are
   examples of convergent evolution. The vertebrate endocrine system consists of glands (pituitary,
   thyroid, adrenal), and diffuse cell groups scattered in epithelial tissues.

   More than fifty different hormones are secreted. Endocrine glands arise during development for
   all three embryologic tissue layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm). The type of endocrine
   product is determined by which tissue layer a gland originated in. Glands of ectodermal and
   endodermal origin produce peptide and amine hormones; mesodermal-origin glands secrete hormones
   based on lipids.

  Endocrine Systems and Feedback Cycles | Back to Top

   The endocrine system uses cycles and negative feedback to regulate physiological functions.
   Negative feedback regulates the secretion of almost every hormone. Cycles of secretion maintain
   physiological and homeostatic control. These cycles can range from hours to months in duration.

                                          [negfeedback.gif]

  Mechanisms of Hormone Action | Back to Top

   The endocrine system acts by releasing hormones that in turn trigger actions in specific target
   cells. Receptors on target cell membranes bind only to one type of hormone. More than fifty
   human hormones have been identified; all act by binding to receptor molecules. The binding
   hormone changes the shape of the receptor causing the response to the hormone. There are two
   mechanisms of hormone action on all target cells.

    Nonsteroid Hormones

   Nonsteroid hormones (water soluble) do not enter the cell but bind to plasma membrane receptors,
   generating a chemical signal (second messenger) inside the target cell. Five different second
   messenger chemicals, including cyclic AMP have been identified. Second messengers activate other
   intracellular chemicals to produce the target cell response.

   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with
   permission.

    Steroid Hormones

   The second mechanism involves steroid hormones, which pass through the plasma membrane and act
   in a two step process. Steroid hormones bind, once inside the cell, to the nuclear membrane
   receptors, producing an activated hormone-receptor complex. The activated hormone-receptor
   complex binds to DNA and activates specific genes, increasing production of proteins.

  Endocrine-related Problems | Back to Top

    1. Overproduction of a hormone
    2. Underproduction of a hormone
    3. Nonfunctional receptors that cause target cells to become insensitive to hormones

  The Nervous and Endocrine Systems | Back to Top

   The pituitary gland (often called the master gland) is located in a small bony cavity at the
   base of the brain. A stalk links the pituitary to the hypothalamus, which controls release of
   pituitary hormones. The pituitary gland has two lobes: the anterior and posterior lobes. The
   anterior pituitary is glandular.

                                           [endocrorgs.gif]

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   The hypothalamus contains neurons that control releases from the anterior pituitary. Seven
   hypothalamic hormones are released into a portal system connecting the hypothalamus and
   pituitary, and cause targets in the pituitary to release eight hormones.

   Growth hormone (GH) is a peptide anterior pituitary hormone essential for growth. GH-releasing
   hormone stimulates release of GH. GH-inhibiting hormone suppresses the release of GH. The
   hypothalamus maintains homeostatic levels of GH. Cells under the action of GH increase in size
   (hypertrophy) and number (hyperplasia). GH also causes increase in bone length and thickness by
   deposition of cartilage at the ends of bones. During adolescence, sex hormones cause replacement
   of cartilage by bone, halting further bone growth even though GH is still present. Too little or
   two much GH can cause dwarfism or gigantism, respectively.

   Hypothalamus receptors monitor blood levels of thyroid hormones. Low blood levels of
   Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) cause the release of TSH-releasing hormone from the
   hypothalamus, which in turn causes the release of TSH from the anterior pituitary. TSH travels
   to the thyroid where it promotes production of thyroid hormones, which in turn regulate
   metabolic rates and body temperatures.

   Gonadotropins and prolactin are also secreted by the anterior pituitary. Gonadotropins (which
   include follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH, and luteinizing hormone, LH) affect the gonads by
   stimulating gamete formation and production of sex hormones. Prolactin is secreted near the end
   of pregnancy and prepares the breasts for milk production. .

    The Posterior Pituitary

   The posterior pituitary stores and releases hormones into the blood. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
   and oxytocin are produced in the hypothalamus and transported by axons to the posterior
   pituitary where they are dumped into the blood. ADH controls water balance in the body and blood
   pressure. Oxytocin is a small peptide hormone that stimulates uterine contractions during
   childbirth.

  Other Endocrine Organs | Back to Top

    The Adrenal Glands

   Each kidney has an adrenal gland located above it. The adrenal gland is divided into an inner
   medulla and an outer cortex. The medulla synthesizes amine hormones, the cortex secretes steroid
   hormones. The adrenal medulla consists of modified neurons that secrete two hormones:
   epinephrine and norepinephrine. Stimulation of the cortex by the sympathetic nervous system
   causes release of hormones into the blood to initiate the "fight or flight" response. The
   adrenal cortex produces several steroid hormones in three classes: mineralocorticoids,
   glucocorticoids, and sex hormones. Mineralocorticoids maintain electrolyte balance.
   Glucocorticoids produce a long-term, slow response to stress by raising blood glucose levels
   through the breakdown of fats and proteins; they also suppress the immune response and inhibit
   the inflammatory response.

   of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

    The Thyroid Gland

   The thyroid gland is located in the neck. Follicles in the thyroid secrete thyroglobulin, a
   storage form of thyroid hormone. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary
   causes conversion of thyroglobulin into thyroid hormones T4 and T3. Almost all body cells are
   targets of thyroid hormones.

   Thyroid hormone increases the overall metabolic rate, regulates growth and development as well
   as the onset of sexual maturity. Calcitonin is also secreted by large cells in the thyroid; it
   plays a role in regulation of calcium.

    The Pancreas

   The pancreas contains exocrine cells that secrete digestive enzymes into the small intestine and
   clusters of endocrine cells (the pancreatic islets). The islets secrete the hormones insulin and
   glucagon, which regulate blood glucose levels.

   After a meal, blood glucose levels rise, prompting the release of insulin, which causes cells to
   take up glucose, and liver and skeletal muscle cells to form the carbohydrate glycogen. As
   glucose levels in the blood fall, further insulin production is inhibited. Glucagon causes the
   breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which in turn is released into the blood to maintain glucose
   levels within a homeostatic range. Glucagon production is stimulated when blood glucose levels
   fall, and inhibited when they rise.

   Diabetes results from inadequate levels of insulin. Type I diabetes is characterized by
   inadequate levels of insulin secretion, often due to a genetic cause. Type II usually develops
   in adults from both genetic and environmental causes. Loss of response of targets to insulin
   rather than lack of insulin causes this type of diabetes. Diabetes causes impairment in the
   functioning of the eyes, circulatory system, nervous system, and failure of the kidneys.
   Diabetes is the second leading cause of blindness in the US. Treatments involve daily injections
   of insulin, monitoring of blood glucose levels and a controlled diet.

  Other Chemical Messengers | Back to Top

   Interferons are proteins released when a cell has been attacked by a virus. They cause
   neighboring cells to produce antiviral proteins. Once activated, these proteins destroy the
   virus.

   Prostaglandins are fatty acids that behave in many ways like hormones. They are produced by most
   cells in the body and act on neighboring cells.

   Pheromones are chemical signals that travel between organisms rather than between cells within
   an organism. Pheromones are used to mark territory, signal prospective mates, and communicate.
   The presence of a human sex attractant/pheromone has not been established conclusively.

  Biological Cycles | Back to Top

   Biological cycles ranging from minutes to years occur throughout the animal kingdom. Cycles
   involve hibernation, mating behavior, body temperature and many other physiological processes.

   Rhythms or cycles that show cyclic changes on a daily (or even a few hours) basis are known as
   circadian rhythms. Many hormones, such as ACTH-cortisol, TSH, and GH show circadian rhythms.

   The menstrual cycle is controlled by a number of hormones secreted in a cyclical fashion.
   Thyroid secretion is usually higher in winter than in summer. Childbirth is hormonally
   controlled, and is highest between 2 and 7 AM.

   Internal cycles of hormone production are controlled by the hypothalamus, specifically the
   suprachiasmic nucleus (SCN). According to one model, the SCN is signaled by messages from the
   light-detecting retina of the eyes.The SCN signals the pineal gland in the brain to signal the
   hypothalamus, etc.
