  Viruses: a Group of Intracellular Parasites | Back to Top

   Louis Pasteur suspected something smaller than bacteria caused rabies. For this small infectious
   substance he used Latin term for "poison." Russian biologist Dimitri Ivanowsky worked with
   tobacco mosaic virus. In 1892 he confirmed Pasteur's hypothesis of an infectious agent smaller
   than bacteria. The invention of the electron microscope in the twentieth century allowed
   visualization of these infectious agents that we know as viruses.

   A virus is a submicroscopic infectious particle composed of a protein coat and a nucleic acid
   core, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Viruses are similar in size to a large protein macromolecule,
   generally smaller than 200 nm in diameter. Viruses, like cells, carry genetic information
   encoded in their nucleic acid, and can undergo mutations and reproduce; however, they cannot
   carry out metabolism, and thus are not considered alive. Viruses are classified by the type of
   nucleic acid they contain, and the shape of their protein capsule. Examples of several viruses
   are shown in Figures 1-3.

                                             [flu3c.gif]

   All viruses have at least two parts. An outer capsid, composed of protein subunits.surrounds an
   inner core of either DNA or RNA, but not both. The viral genome is at most several hundred
   genes. In contrast, a human cell contains over thirty thousand genes. A viral particle may also
   contain various proteins, especially enzymes (e.g., polymerases), needed to produce viral DNA or
   RNA.

   Several different replication cycle types are known for viruses. Some viruses (simuilar to that
   shown in the animated GIF in Figure 4, attach to the outside of the host cell.

                                             [t4anim.gif]

   Viruses are obligate intracellular
   parasites that can be maintained only inside living cells. Whern we refer to something as
   "obligate" that indicates that the virus (in this case) must do or behave in the specified
   manner. Since viruses are obligate intraellular parasites, the term conveys the idea that
   viruses must carry out their reproduction by parasitizing a host cell. They cannot multiply
   outside a living cell, they can only replicate inside of a specific host. Animal viruses in
   laboratories are raised in live chick embryos or propagated in cell tissue culture. Viruses
   infect all sorts of cells, from bacteria to human cells, but for the most part tend to be host
   specific. For example, the tobacco mosaic virus infects certain plants; the rabies virus infects
   only mammals; and the AIDS virus, HIV, infects only certain human blood cells. The various
   viruses that cause hepatitis invade only liver tissues, while the polio virus only reproduces in
   spinal nerve cells. Figure 5 shows a bacterial virus, as well as an HIV human virus.

   Viruses gain entry and are specific to a particular host cell because portions of the capsid (or
   spikes of the envelope) adhere to specific receptor sites on host cell plasma membrane. Their
   nucleic acid then enters the cell, where the viral genome codes for production of protein units
   in the capsid. Bacteriophages invade the host cell, take over the cell, and begin replicating
   viruses, eventually lysing or bursting the host cell, releasing the new viruses to infect
   additional cells. Figure 6 illustrates a typical T bacteriophage, as well as several of these
   viruses being assembled in a host.

   Other bacteriophages can infect a host and insert their DNA into the host DNA. Under certain
   conditions the viral DNA can detach and direct replication of new virus, eventually killing the
   host cell. Once inside the cell, the nucleic acid follows one of two paths: lytic or lysogenic,
   as shown in Figure 7. Virus may have genes for a few special enzymes needed for the virus to
   reproduce and exit from the host cell. The virus relies on host enzymes, ribosomes, transfer RNA
   (tRNA), and ATP for its own replication. A virus in essence takes over the metabolic machinery
   of the host cell when it reproduces.

   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   [vcycle_2.gif]

   [vcycle_3.gif]

   The lytic cycle is one in which the virus takes over operation of the bacterium immediately upon
   entering it, with the production of new viruses and their subsequent release destroying the
   bacterium. The lysogenic cycle is seen when the virus incorporates its DNA into that of the
   bacterium, with some delay until the production of new viruses. Following attachment and
   penetration, viral DNA becomes integrated into bacterial DNA with no destruction of host DNA.
   When this occurs, the phage is latent, and the viral DNA is called a prophage. This prophage is
   replicated along with host DNA, so all subsequent cells produced by the infected but latent cell
   (lysogenic cells) carry a copy of the prophage. Certain environmental factors (for example,
   ultraviolet radiation) induce the prophage to enter the biosynthesis stage of the lytic cycle,
   followed by maturation and release.

   Still other viruses invade animal cells and replicate without killing the host cell immediately.
   New viruses are released by budding off the host cell's plasma membrane, turning the host cell
   for a time into a viral factory. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the retrovirus that
   causes AIDS, replicates in this way.

   Animal viruses replicate very muck like bacteriophages do, although with modifications. If the
   virus has an envelope, glycoprotein spikes first adhere to plasma membrane receptors. The entire
   virus (not just the viral nucleic acid) is then taken into the host cell by endocytosis. Once
   inside the host cell, the virus loses its envelope and capsid. The viral nucleic acid, now free
   of its covering, proceeds with biosynthesis. Newly assembled viral particles are released not
   vial cell lysis, but rather by budding. During this process, the viral particles pick up their
   envelopes on host cell membrane. Components of viral envelopes are obtained from the plasma
   membrane as the viruses leave the cell. Budding does not necessarily result in the death of the
   host cell. This process is shown in Figure 8.

   Retroviruses

   Retroviruses use RNA instead of DNA as their nucleic acid core. They also contain the enzyme
   reverse transcriptase, which will detranscribe the RNA sequence into a DNA strand.. Once the
   retroviral RNA and reverse transcriptase are inside the host cell, as shown in Figure 9, the
   enzyme reverses transcription by making a single stranded DNA from the retroviral RNA. Viral DNA
   can be integrated into the host DNA. It remains in the genome and is replicated whenever the
   host DNA replicates. If viral DNA is transcribed, new viruses are produced by biosynthesis,
   maturation, and release by budding. Retroviruses include HIV and also cause certain forms of
   cancer.

  Viruses and Diseases | Back to Top

   Viruses cause a variety of diseases among all groups of living things. Viral plant diseases can
   be controlled solely by burning those plants that show symptoms of disease. Viral diseases in
   humans are controlled by preventing transmission, administering vaccines, and only recently by
   the administration of antiviral drugs. Virally caused human diseases include the flu, common
   cold, herpes, measles, chicken pox, small pox, and encephalitis. Antibiotics are not effective
   against viruses. Vaccination offers protection for uninfected individuals. Frequent hand washing
   and condom use may help prevent transmission. Vaccines are substances that stimulate an immune
   response without causing the illness. Commonly used virus vaccines include polio, measles, and
   mumps.

   Antibiotics do not cure viral infections because viruses use enzymes produced by the host cell,
   rather than produce not their own. A few antiviral drugs are available that interfere with viral
   replication without interfering with host metabolism in cells free of the virus. Antivirals
   include acyclovir for herpes and AZT for AIDS. Despite recent successes with antiviral drugs,
   vaccination and the prevention of exposure remain the most effective ways to deal with viral
   infections.

   Smallpox was effectively elimated as a scourge on humanity by worldwide vaccination programs. In
   fact the chances of getting smallpox from a bad vaccine were greater than that of ever
   encountering the virus in nature. The last U.S. case of smallpox occurred in 1949, with the
   world's last naturally occurring case was from Somalia in 1977. For this reason, in 1972 routine
   U.S. smallpox vaccinations were discontinued. However, recent (September 2001) concerns about
   bioweapons and bioterrorism have led the U.S. government to consider plans to vaccinate the
   population against smallpox.

   Hepatitis A, B, and C are all viral diseases that can cause liver damage. Like any viral
   disease, the major treatment efforts focus on treatment of symptoms, not removal of the viral
   cause.

   Hepatitis A is usually a mild malady indicated by a sudden fever, malaise, nausea, anorexia, and
   abdominal discomfort. The virus causing Hepatitis A is primarilly transmitted by fecal
   contamination, although contaminated food and water also can promote transmission.

   A rare disease in the United States, hepatitis B is endemic in parts of Asia where hundreds of
   millions of individuals are possibly infected. The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) may be transmitted by
   blood and blood products as well as sexual contact. The blood supply in developed countries has
   been screened for the virus that causes this disease for many years, and transmission by blood
   transfusion is rare. The risk of HBV infection is high among promiscuous homosexual men although
   it is also transmitted hetereosexually. Correct use of condoms is thought to reduce or eliminate
   the risk of transmission. Effective vaccines are available for the prevention of Hepatitis B
   infection. Some individuals with chronic hepatitis B may develop cirrhosis of the liver.
   Individuals with chronic hepatitis B are at an increased risk of developing primary liver
   cancer. Although this type of cancer is relatively rare in the United States, it is the leading
   cause of cancer death in the world, primarily because the virus causing it is endemic in eastern
   Asia.

   Hepatitis C affects approximately 170 million people worldwide and 4 million in the United
   States. The virus is transmitted primarily by blood and blood products. Most infected
   individuals have either received blood transfusions prior to 1990 (when screening of the blood
   supply for the Hepatitis C virus began) or have used intravenous drugs. Sexual transmission can
   occur between monogamous couples (rare) but infection is far more common in those who are
   promiscuous. In rare cases, Hepatitis C causes acute disease and even liver failure. About
   twenty percent of individuals with Hepatitis C who develop cirrhosis of the liver will also
   develop severe liver disease. Cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis C is presently the leading cause of
   the need for liver transplants in the United States. Individuals with cirrhosis from Hepatitis C
   also bear increased chances of developing primary liver cancer. All current treatments for
   Hepatitis C employ of various preparations of the potent antiviral interferon alpha. However,
   not all patients who have the disease are good candidates for treatment, so infected individuals
   are urged to regularly consult their physician.

    Vaccination

   Vaccination is a term derived from the Latin vacca (cow, after the cowpox material used by
   British physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) in the first vaccination in 1796). A vaccine
   stimulates the antibody production and formation of memory cells without causing of the disease.
   Vaccines are made from killed pathogens or weakened strains that cause antibody production but
   not the disease. Recombinant DNA techniques can now be used to develop even safer vaccines.

   The immune system can develop long-term immunity to some diseases. Man can use this to develop
   vaccines, which produce induced immunity. Active immunity develops after an illness or vaccine.
   Vaccines are weakened (or killed) viruses or bacteria that prompt the development of antibodies.
   Application of biotechnology allows development of vaccines that are the protein (antigen) which
   in no way can cause the disease. Passive immunity is the type of immunity when the individual is
   given antibodies to combat a specific disease. Passive immunity is short-lived.

    Emergent Viruses

   Viruses are usually quite specific as to their hosts and even to the types of cells they infect
   in a multicellular host. Recently, some viruses appear to have shifted their host: HIV,
   hantavirus, and ebola appear to be either viruses shifting to a new (human) host or else viruses
   whose existence and effects are just now being realized by scientists and the general public.

  Viroids and Prions | Back to Top

   Viruses would appear to be the simplest form of infectious particle. The discovery of viroids,
   nucleic acid without a protein capsule, and prions, infectious proteins, subtracts another level
   of complexity. Both viroids and prions can cause diseases, the most famous of which is mad cow
   disease (caused by a prion).
