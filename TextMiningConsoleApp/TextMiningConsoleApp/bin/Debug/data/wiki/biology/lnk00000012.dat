On-Line Biology Book: GLOSSARY

                                                  O

   occipital lobe  The lobe of the cerebral cortex located at the rear of the head; is responsible
   for receiving and processing visual information. PICTURE

   oils  Triglycerides that are liquid at room temperature.

   oncogenes  Genes that can activate cell division in cells that normally do not divide or do so
   only slowly. A gene that when over-expressed leads to cancer, but which normally functions in
   cell division.

   "one gene, one enzyme hypothesis Holds that a single gene controls the production, specificity,
   and activity of each enzyme in a metabolic pathway. Thus, mutation of such a gene changes the
   ability of the cell to carry out a particular reaction and disrupts the entire pathway.

   "one gene one polypeptide hypothesis"  A revision of the one gene, one enzyme hypothesis. Some
   proteins are composed of different polypeptide chains encoded by separate genes, so the
   hypothesis now holds that mutation in a gene encoding a specifc polypeptide can alter the
   ability of the encoded protein to function and thus produce an altered phenotype.

   oocyte A cell that will/is undergo/ing development into a female gamete. PICTURE

   oogenesis  The production of ova. The development of a diploid cell into a haploid ovum or egg
   cell. PICTURE

   open community  A community in which the populations have different density peaks and range
   boundaries and are distributed more or less randomly.

   opposable  The capability of being placed against the remaining digits of a hand or foot; e.g.,
   the ability of the thumb to touch the tips of the fingers on that hand.

   opsins  Molecules in cone cells that bind to pigments, creating a complex that is sensitive to
   light of a given wavelength.

   orders  Taxonomic subcategories of classes. PICTURE

   Ordovician extinction Paleozoic-aged mass extinction possibly related to glaciation in the
   southern-hemisphere supercontinent Gondwana.

   Ordovician Period Geologic period of the Paleozoic Era after the Cambrian Period between 500 and
   435 million years ago. Major advances during this period include the bony fish and possibly land
   plants (during the late Ordovician). PICTURE

   organelles  Cell components that carry out individual functions; e.g., the cell nucleus and the
   endoplasmic reticulum. Subcellular structures (usually membrane-bound and unique to eukaryotes)
   that perform some function, e.g. chloroplast, mitochondrion, nucleus. PICTURE 1 | PICTURE 2

   organism  An individual, composed of organ systems (if multicellular). Multiple organisms make
   up a population.

   organs  Differentiated structures consisting of tissues and performing some specific function in
   an organism. Structures made of two or more tissues which function as an integrated unit. e.g.
   the heart, kidneys, liver, stomach.

   organ systems  Groups of organs that perform related functions.

   orgasm  Rhythmic muscular contractions of the genitals (sex organs) combined with waves of
   intense pleasurable sensations; in males, results in the ejaculation of semen.

   osmoconformers  Marine organisms that have no system of osmoregulation and must change the
   composition of their body þuids as the composition of the water changes; include invertebrates
   such as jellyÞsh, scallops, and crabs.

   osmoregulation  The regulation of the movement of water by osmosis into and out of cells; the
   maintenance of water balance within the body.

   osmoregulators  Marine vertebrates whose body þuids have about one-third the solute
   concentration of seawater; must therefore undergo osmoregulation.

   osmosis  Diffusion of water molecules across a membrane in response to differences in solute
   concentration. Water moves from areas of high-water/low-solute concentration to areas of
   low-water/high-solute concentration. Diffusion of water across a semi-permeable barrier such as
   a cell membrane, from high water potential (concentration) to lower water potential
   (concentration).

   osmotic pressure Pressure generated by water moving by osmosis into or out of a cell.

   ossification The process by which embryonic cartilage is replaced with bone. PICTURE

   osteoarthritis  A degenerative condition associated with the wearing away of the protective cap
   of cartilage at the ends of bones. Bone growths or spurs develop, restricting movement and
   causing pain.

   osteoblasts  Bone-forming cells. PICTURE

   osteoclasts  Cells that remove material to form the central cavity in a long bone. PICTURE

   osteocytes  Bone cells that lay down new bone; found in the concentric layers of compact bone.
   Bone cell, a type of connective tissue. PICTURE

   osteoporosis  A disorder in which the mineral portion of bone is lost, making the bone weak and
   brittle; occurs most commonly in postmenopausal women.

   out of Africa hypothesis  Holds that modern human populations (Homo sapiens) are all derived
   from a single speciation event that took place in a restricted region in Africa.

   ovaries  1) In animals, the female gonads, which produce eggs (ova) and female sex hormones.
   PICTURE 2) In þowers, part of the female reproductive structure in the carpel; contain the
   ovules, where egg development occurs. The lower part of the carpel that contains the ovules
   within which the female gametophyte develops. PICTURE

   overkill  The shooting, trapping, or poisoning of certain populations, usually for sport or
   economic reasons.

   oviducts  Tubes that connect the ovaries and the uterus; transport sperm to the ova, transport
   the fertilized ova to the uterus, and serve as the site of fertilization; also called the
   fallopian tubes or uterine tubes. PICTURE

   ovulation  The release of the oocyte onto the surface of the ovary; occurs at the midpoint of
   the ovarian cycle. The release of the ovum (egg) from the ovary after the peaking of luteinizing
   hormone concentration in the blood during the menstrual cycle. PICTURE 1 | PICTURE 2

   ovule  In seed plants, a protective structure in which the female gametophyte develops,
   fertilization occurs, and seeds develop; contained within the ovary. Structures inside the ovary
   of the flower within which the female gametophyte develops after megasporogenesis has produced a
   megaspore inside each ovule. PICTURE

   ovum  The female gamete, egg.

   oxidation  The loss of electrons from the outer shell of an atom; often accompanied by the
   transfer of a proton and thus involves the loss of a hydrogen ion. The loss of electrons or
   hydrogens in a chemical reaction. PICTURE

   oxytocin  A peptide hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary that stimulates the contraction
   of the uterus during childbirth.

   ozone  A triatomic (O[3]) form of oxygen that is formed in the stratosphere when sunlight
   strikes oxygen atoms. This atmospheric ozone helps Þlter radiation from the sun.
