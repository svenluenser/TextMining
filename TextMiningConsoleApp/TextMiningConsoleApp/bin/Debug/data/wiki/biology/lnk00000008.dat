   Welcome to an On-Line Biology Book Table of Contents. Click on the underlined items to go to
   those chapters. The text items are modified lecture outlines I have developed over the many
   years of teaching college-level introductory biology. Use of my text for educational purposes is
   encouraged and appreciated, however many illustrations are taken off the web, and I have
   indicated the source page (when that page still is an active link) and tried to provide a link
   back to the original. In addition, several companies have most graciously allowed me to use
   their images. If you are desiring to use these images yourself please contact the party
