Structure of Water | Back to Top

   It can be quite correctly argued that life exists on Earth because of the abundant liquid water.
   Other planets have water, but they either have it as a gas (Venus) or ice (Mars). This
   relationship is shown in Figure 1. Recent studies of Mars reveal the presence sometime in the
   past of running fluid, possibly water. The chemical nature of water is thus one we must examine
   as it permeates living systems: water is a universal solvent, and can be too much of a good
   thing for some cells to deal with.

   Figure 1. Water can exist in all three states of matter on Earth, while only in one state on our
   two nearest neighboring planets. The above graph is from
   http://www.crseo.ucsb.edu/IOM2/Triple_Point.html.

                                         [Triple_Point_2.gif]

   Water is polar covalently bonded within the molecule. This unequal sharing of the electrons
   results in a slightly positive and a slightly negative side of the molecule. Other molecules,
   such as Ethane, are nonpolar, having neither a positive nor a negative side, as shown in Figure
   2.

   Figure 2. The difference between a polar (water) and nonpolar (ethane) molecule is due to the
   unequal sharing of electrons within the polar molecule. Nonpolar molecules have electrons
   equally shared within their covalent bonds. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of

   These link up by the hydrogen bond discussed earlier. Consequently, water has a great
   interconnectivity of individual molecules, which is caused by the individually weak hydrogen
   bonds, shown in Figure 3, that can be quite strong when taken by the billions.

   oxygen side of another water molecule. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology,

                                           [Hbondswat.gif]

   Water has been referred to as the universal solvent. Living things are composed of atoms and
   molecules within aqueous solutions (solutions that have materials dissolved in water). Solutions
   are uniform mixtures of the molecules of two or more substances. The solvent is usually the
   substance present in the greatest amount (and is usually also a liquid). The substances of
   lesser amounts are the solutes.

   The solubility of many molecules is determined by their molecular structure. You are familiar
   with the phrase "mixing like oil and water." The biochemical basis for this phrase is that the
   organic macromolecules known as lipids (of which fats are an important, although often
   troublesome, group) have areas that lack polar covalent bonds. The polar covalently bonded water
   molecules act to exclude nonpolar molecules, causing the fats to clump together. The structure
   of many molecules can greatly influence their solubility. Sugars, such as glucose, have many
   hydroxyl (OH) groups, which tend to increase the solubility of the molecule. This aspect of
   water is illustrated in Figure 4.

   Figure 4. Dissolution of an ionically bonded compound, sodium chloride, by water molecules.

                                           [dissolNACL.gif]

   Water tends to disassociate into H^+ and OH^- ions. In this disassociation, the oxygen retains
   the electrons and only one of the hydrogens, becoming a negatively charged ion known as
   hydroxide. Pure water has the same number (or concentration) of H^+ as OH^- ions. Acidic
   solutions have more H^+ ions than OH^- ions. Basic solutions have the opposite.The pH of several
   common solutions is shown in Figure 5. An acid causes an increase in the numbers of H^+ ions and
   a base causes an increase in the numbers of OH^- ions.

   Figure 5. pH of some common items. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th
   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with

                                            [acidbase.gif]

   The pH scale is a logarithmic scale representing the concentration of H^+ ions in a solution.
   Remember that as the H^+ concentration increases the OH^- concentration decreases and vice versa
   . If we have a solution with one in every ten molecules being H^+, we refer to the concentration
   of H^+ ions as 1/10. Remember from algebra that we can write a fraction as a negative exponent,
   thus 1/10 becomes 10^-1. Conversely 1/100 becomes 10^-2 , 1/1000 becomes 10^-3, etc. Logarithms
   are exponents to which a number (usually 10) has been raised. For example log 10 (pronounced
   "the log of 10") = 1 (since 10 may be written as 10^1). The log 1/10 (or 10^-1) = -1. pH, a
   measure of the concentration of H^+ ions, is the negative log of the H^+ ion concentration. If
   the pH of water is 7, then the concentration of H^+ ions is 10^-7, or 1/10,000,000. In the case
   of strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), an acid secreted by the lining of your
   stomach, [H^+] (the concentration of H^+ ions, written in a chemical shorthand) is 10^-1;
   therefore the pH is 1.

Organic molecules | Back to Top

   Organic molecules are those that: 1) formed by the actions of living things; and/or 2) have a
   carbon backbone. Methane (CH[4]) is an example of this. If we remove the H from one of the
   methane units below, and begin linking them up, while removing other H units, we begin to form
   an organic molecule. (NOTE: Not all methane is organically derived, methane is a major component
   of the atmosphere of Jupiter, which we think is devoid of life). When two methanes are combined,
   the resultant molecule is Ethane, which has a chemical formula C[2]H[6]. Molecules made up of H
   and C are known as hydrocarbons. The formulas and structural representations of several simple
   organic molecules are shown in Figure 6.

   Figure 6. Types of hydrocarbon compounds and their structure. Images from Purves et al., Life:
   The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   [fungps_2.gif]

   Scientists eventually realized that specific chemical properties were a result of the presence
   of particular functional groups. Functional groups are clusters of atoms with characteristic
   structure and functions. Polar molecules (with +/- charges) are attracted to water molecules and
   are hydrophilic. Nonpolar molecules are repelled by water and do not dissolve in water; are
   hydrophobic. Hydrocarbon is hydrophobic except when it has an attached ionized functional group
   such as carboxyl (acid) (COOH), then molecule is hydrophilic. Since cells are 70-90% water, the
   degree to which organic molecules interact with water affects their function. One of the most
   common groups is the -OH (hydroxyl) group. Its presence will enable a molecule to be water
   soluble.

   Isomers are molecules with identical molecular formulas but differ in arrangement of their atoms
   (e.g., glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone). Selected functional groups and related data are
   shown in Figure 7.

   Figure 7. Functional groups in organic molecules. Images from Purves et al., Life: The Science
   of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   [fungpsb3.gif]

   Carbon has four electrons in outer shell, and can bond with up to four other atoms (usually H,
   O, N, or another C). Since carbon can make covalent bonds with another carbon atom, carbon
   chains and rings that serve as the backbones of organic molecules are possible.

   Chemical bonds store energy. The C-C covalent bond has 83.1 Kcal (kilocalories) per mole, while
   the C=C double covalent bond has 147 Kcal/mole. Energy is in two forms: kinetic, or energy in
   use/motion; and potential, or energy at rest or in storage. Chemical bonds are potential energy,
   until they are converted into another form of energy, kinetic energy (according to the two laws
   of thermodynamics).

   Each organic molecule group has small molecules (monomers) that are linked to form a larger
   organic molecule (macromolecule). Monomers can be jouined together to form polymers that are the
   large macromolecules made of three to millions of monomer subunits.

   Macromolecules are constructed by covalently bonding monomers by condensation reactions where
   water is removed from functional groups on the monomers. Cellular enzymes carry out condensation
   (and the reversal of the reaction, hydrolysis of polymers). Condensation involves a dehydration
   synthesis because a water is removed (dehydration) and a bond is made (synthesis). When two
   monomers join, a hydroxyl (OH) group is removed from one monomer and a hydrogen (H) is removed
   from the other. This produces the water given off during a condensation reaction. Hydrolysis
   (hydration) reactions break down polymers in reverse of condensation; a hydroxyl (OH) group from
   water attaches to one monomer and hydrogen (H) attaches to the other.

   There are four classes of macromolecules (polysaccharides, triglycerides, polypeptides, nucleic
   acids). These classes perform a variety of functions in cells.

   1. Carbohydrates have the general formula [CH[2]O][n] where n is a number between 3 and 6. Note
   the different CH[2]O units in Figure 8. Carbohydrates function in short-term energy storage
   (such as sugar); as intermediate-term energy storage (starch for plants and glycogen for
   animals); and as structural components in cells (cellulose in the cell walls of plants and many
   protists), and chitin in the exoskeleton of insects and other arthropods.

   Sugars are structurally the simplest carbohydrates. They are the structural unit which makes up
   the other types of carbohydrates. Monosaccharides are single (mono=one) sugars. Important
   monosaccharides include ribose (C[5]H[10]O[5]), glucose (C[6]H[12]O[6]), and fructose (same
   formula but different structure than glucose).

   Figure 8. The chain (left) and ring (center and right) method of representing carbohydrates.

                                            [tripent.gif]

   We classify monosaccharides by the number of carbon atoms and the types of functional groups
   present in the sugar. For example, glucose and fructose, illustrated in Figure 9, have the same
   chemical formula (C[6]H[12]O[6]), but a different structure: glucose having an aldehyde
   (internal hydroxyl shown as: -OH) and fructose having a keto group (internal double-bond O,
   shown as: =O). This functional group difference, as small as it seems, accounts for the greater
   sweetness of fructose as compared to glucose.

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                    [glucrings.gif] [frucring.gif]

   In an aqueous solution, glucose tends to have two structures, a (alpha) and b (beta), with an
   intermediate straight-chain form (shown in Figure 10). The a form and b form differ in the
   location of one -OH group, as shown in Figure 9. Glucose is a common hexose, six carbon sugar,
   in plants. The products of photosynthesis are assembled to form glucose. Energy from sunlight is
   converted into and stored as C-C covalent bond energy. This energy is released in living
   organisms in such a way that not enough heat is generated at once to incinerate the organisms.
   One mole of glucose yields 673 Kcal of energy. (A calorie is the amount of heat needed to raise
   one gram of water one degree C. A Kcal has 1000 times as much energy as a cal.). Glucose is also
   the form of sugar measured in the human bloodstream.

   Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides are chemically bonded together. Sucrose, a
   common plant disaccharide is composed of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose. Lactose, milk
   sugar, is a disaccharide composed of glucose and the monosaccharide galactose. The maltose that
   flavors a malted milkshake (and other items) is also a disaccharide made of two glose molecules
   bonded together as shown in Figure 11.

   disaccharides. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer

                                             [disacc.gif]

   Polysaccharides are large molecules composed of individual monosaccharide units. A common plant
   polysaccharide is starch (shown in Figure 12), which is made up of many glucoses (in a
   polypeptide these are referred to as glucans). Two forms of polysaccharide, amylose and
   amylopectin makeup what we commonly call starch. The formation of the ester bond by condensation
   (the removal of water from a molecule) allows the linking of monosaccharides into disaccharides
   and polysaccharides. Glycogen (see Figure 12) is an animal storage product that accumulates in
   the vertebrate liver.

   et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and

                                            [cellulo.gif]

   Cellulose, illustrated in Figure 13 and 14, is a polysaccharide found in plant cell walls.
   Cellulose forms the fibrous part of the plant cell wall. In terms of human diets, cellulose is
   indigestible, and thus forms an important, easily obtained part of dietary fiber. As compared to
   starch and glycogen, which are each made up of mixtures of a and b glucoses, cellulose (and the
   animal structural polysaccharide chitin) are made up of only b glucoses. The three-dimensional
   structure of these polysaccharides is thus constrained into straight microfibrils by the uniform
   nature of the glucoses, which resist the actions of enzymes (such as amylase) that breakdown
   storage polysaccharides (such a starch).

   2. Lipids are involved mainly with long-term energy storage. They are generally insoluble in
   polar substances such as water. Secondary functions of lipids include structural components (as
   in the case of phospholipids that are the major building block in cell membranes) and
   "messengers" (hormones) that play roles in communications within and between cells. Lipids are
   composed of three fatty acids (usually) covalently bonded to a 3-carbon glycerol. The fatty
   acids are composed of CH[2] units, and are hydrophobic/not water soluble. Some examples of fatty
   acids are shown in Figure 15.

   Fatty acids can be saturated (meaning they have as many hydrogens bonded to their carbons as
   possible) or unsaturated (with one or more double bonds connecting their carbons, hence fewer
   hydrogens). A fat is solid at room temperature, while an oil is a liquid under the same
   conditions. The fatty acids in oils are mostly unsaturated, while those in fats are mostly
   saturated.

   Figure 15. Saturated (top and middle) and unsaturated (bottom) fatty acids. The term staurated
   refers to the "saturation" of the molecule by hydrogen atoms. The presence of a double C=C
   covalent bond reduces the number of hydrogens that can bond to the carbon chain, hence the
   application of therm "unsaturated". Images from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th
   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with

                                            [fatacids.gif]

   [unsatfat.gif]

   Fats and oils function in long-term energy storage. Animals convert excess sugars (beyond their
   glycogen storage capacities) into fats. Most plants store excess sugars as starch, although some
   seeds and fruits have energy stored as oils (e.g. corn oil, peanut oil, palm oil, canola oil,
   and sunflower oil). Fats yield 9.3 Kcal/gm, while carbohydrates yield 3.79 Kcal/gm. Fats thus
   store six times as much energy as glycogen.

   Diets are attempts to reduce the amount of fats present in specialized cells known as adipose
   cells that accumulate in certain areas of the human body. By restricting the intakes of
   carbohydrates and fats, the body is forced to draw on its own stores to makeup the energy debt.
   The body responds to this by lowering its metabolic rate, often resulting in a drop of "energy
   level." Successful diets usually involve three things: decreasing the amounts of carbohydrates
   and fats; exercise; and behavior modification.

   Another use of fats is as insulators and cushions. The human body naturally accumulates some
   fats in the "posterior" area. Subdermal ("under the skin") fat plays a role in insulation.

   Phospholipids and glycolipids are important structural components of cell membranes.
   Phospholipids, shown in Figure 16, are modified so that a phosphate group (PO[4]^-) is added to
   one of the fatty acids. The addition of this group makes a polar "head" and two nonpolar
   "tails". Waxes are an important structural component for many organisms, such as the cuticle, a
   waxy layer covering the leaves and stems of many land plants; and protective coverings on skin
   and fur of animals.

   Cholesterol and steroids: Most mention of these two types of lipids in the news is usually
   negative. Cholesterol, illustrated in Figure 17, has many biological uses, it occurs in cell
   membranes, and its forms the sheath of some types of nerve cells. However, excess cholesterol in
   the blood has been linked to atherosclerosis, hardening of the arteries. Recent studies suggest
   a link between arterial plaque deposits of cholesterol, antibodies to the pneumonia-causing form
   of Chlamydia, and heart attacks. The plaque increases blood pressure, much the way blockages in
   plumbing cause burst pipes in old houses.

   3. Proteins are very important in biological systems as control and structural elements. Control
   functions of proteins are carried out by enzymes and proteinaceous hormones. Enzymes are
   chemicals that act as organic catalysts (a catalyst is a chemical that promotes but is not
   changed by a chemical reaction). Click here for an illustrated page about enzymes. Structural
   proteins function in the cell membrane, muscle tissue, etc.

   The building block of any protein is the amino acid, which has an amino end (NH[2]) and a
   carboxyl end (COOH). The struucture of a generalized aminio acid as well as the specific
   structures of the 20 biological amino acids are shown in Figure 18 and 19 respectively. The R
   indicates the variable component (R-group) of each amino acid. Alanine and Valine, for example,
   are both nonpolar amino acids, but they differ, as do all amino acids, by the composition of
   their R-groups. All living things (and even viruses) use various combinations of the same twenty
   amino acids. A very powerful bit of evidence for the phylogenetic connection of all living
   things.

   Amino acids are linked together by joining the amino end of one molecule to the carboxyl end of
   another. Removal of water allows formation of a type of covalent bond known as a peptide bond.
   This process is illustrated in Figure 20.

   Figure 20. Formation of a peptide bond between two amino acids by the condensation (dehydration)
   of the amino end of one amino acid and the acid end of the other amino acid. The above image is
   from http://zebu.uoregon.edu/internet/images/peptide.gif.

                                            [peptide.gif]

   Amino acids are linked together into a polypeptide, the primary structure in the organization of
   proteins. The primary structure of a protein is the sequence of amino acids, which is directly
   related to the sequence of information in the RNA molecule, which in turn is a copy of the
   information in the DNA molecule. Changes in the primary structure can alter the proper
   functioning of the protein. Protein function is usually tied to their three-dimensional
   structure. The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide..

   The secondary structure is the tendency of the polypeptide to coil or pleat due to H-bonding
   between R-groups. The tertiary structure is controlled by bonding (or in some cases repulsion)
   between R-groups. Tertiary structure of an HIV protein and its similarity to gamma interferon
   are shown in Figure 22. Many proteins, such as hemoglobin, are formed from one or more
   polypeptides. Such structure is termed quaternary structure. Structural proteins, such as
   collagen, have regular repeated primary structures. Like the structural carbohydrates, the
   components determine the final shape and ultimately function. Collagens have a variety of
   functions in living things, such as the tendons, hide, and corneas of a cow. Keratin is another
   structural protein. It is found in fingernails, feathers, hair, and rhinoceros horns.
   Microtubules, important in cell division and structures of flagella and cilia (among other
   things), are composed of globular structural proteins.

   4. Nucleic acids are polymers composed of monomer units known as nucleotides. There are a very
   few different types of nucleotides. The main functions of nucleotides are information storage
   (DNA), protein synthesis (RNA), and energy transfers (ATP and NAD). Nucleotides, shown in Figure
   22, consist of a sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate. The sugars are either ribose or
   deoxyribose. They differ by the lack of one oxygen in deoxyribose. Both are pentoses usually in
   a ring form. There are five nitrogenous bases. Purines (Adenine and Guanine) are double-ring
   structures, while pyrimidines (Cytosine, Thymine and Uracil) are single-ringed.

   Deoxyribonucleic acid (better known as DNA) is the physical carrier of inheritance for 99% of
   living organisms. The bases in DNA are C, G, A and T, as shown in Figure 23. We will learn more
   about the DNA structure and function later in the course (click here for a quick look [actually
   take all the time you want!] ;)).

   DNA functions in information storage. The English alphabet has 26 letters that can be variously
   combined to form over 50,000 words. DNA has four letters (C, G, A, and T, the nitrogenous bases)
   that code for twenty words (the twenty amino acids found in all living things) that can make an
   infinite variety of sentences (polypeptides). Changes in the sequences of these basesinformation
   can alter the meaning of a sentence.

   For example take the sentence: I saw Elvis. This implies certain knowledge (that I've been out
   in the sun too long without a hat, etc.).

   If we alter the sentence by inverting the middle word, we get: I was Elvis (thank you, thank you
   very much). Now we have greatly altered the information.

   A third alteration will change the meaning: I was Levis. Clearly the original sentence's meaning
   is now greatly changed.

   Changes in DNA information will be translated into changes in the primary structure of a
   polypeptide, and from there to the secondary and tertiary structures. A mutation is any change
   in the DNA base sequence. Most mutations are harmful, few are neutral, and a very few are
   beneficial and contribute the organism's reproductive success. Mutations are the wellspring of
   variation, variation is central to Darwin and Wallace's theory of evolution by natural
   selection.

   Ribonucleic acid (RNA), shown in Figure 24 was discovered after DNA. DNA, with exceptions in
   chloroplasts and mitochondria, is restricted to the nucleus (in eukaryotes, the nucleoid region
   in prokaryotes). RNA occurs in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm (also remember that it
   occurs as part of the ribosomes that line the rough endoplasmic reticulum). There are three
   types of RNA:

   Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the blueprint for construction of a protein.

   Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the construction site where the protein is made.

   Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the truck delivering the proper amino acid to the site at the right time.

   Details of RNA and its role in protein synthesis are available by clicking here.

   Adenosine triphosphate, better known as ATP (Figure 25), the energy currency or coin of the
   cell, transfers energy from chemical bonds to endergonic (energy absorbing) reactions within the
   cell. Structurally, ATP consists of the adenine nucleotide (ribose sugar, adenine base, and
   phosphate group, PO[4]^-2) plus two other phosphate groups.

   Energy is stored in the covalent bonds between phosphates, with the greatest amount of energy
   (approximately 7 kcal/mole) in the bond between the second and third phosphate groups. This
   covalent bond is known as a pyrophosphate bond.
