Copyrights_____________________________________________________________________

  Disclaiming "Delete after 24 hours", "This is fair use", "Download only, if
  you own the original" or "I am not responsible" may offer some smokescreen,
  but don't fool yourself. Disclaimers won't help you a bit, when doing
  something that is criminalized.

  GAMEz, APPz, SERIALz, CRACKz, MP3z and so on are _ILLEGAL_ to host.

  Disclaimers only help on limiting responsibilities of noncriminalized deeds,
  or criminalized deeds committed by someone else without your consent.

  I.e. "For educational and informational purposes only."
       "If you are a minor, you are not allowed to proceed."
       "Smoking causes cancer."

  Fortunately only one of a quarter million warez hosts ever get sued, if you
  get threats of legal action from RIAA/BSA/SPA, better take them seriously and
  retire or go underground.

Signup_________________________________________________________________________

  Use false information with just generated free e-mail address (also with
  false information) to register.

  like

  your name: Faye King
  email    : fayeking@hotmail.com

  Generate names and addresses with a software made for that purpose, lotsa
  CC generators produce also fake addresses and names.

Redirection____________________________________________________________________

  Redirection services like www.cjb.net offer free redirection. Redirecting URL
  is a good way to keep visitors finding your site especially, if you have to
  move it often.

Terms of service_______________________________________________________________

  The TOS agreement between you and FWP generally issues the operators to right
  to destroy your site without notice, if they consider so whenever, for
  whatever reason. No warning, no notice.

  Deletion reduction methods:

  There is no foolproof method of avoiding deletion, when hosting undesirable
  content you gotta be prepared that sometimes your sites get wiped.

  Have a MIRRORLIST, which lists mirror on other FWPs. Don't host any
  undesirable content on the mainsite. The mirrorlist site gets rarely deleted.

  COVER your site. Make somekind of legitimate pages, but keep an other, real
  page somewhere on the site, unlinked from the public cover.

General tips on FWPs___________________________________________________________

  Get all the accounts you can. Check out www.freewebspace.net for FWPs.

  FWPs rarely hint eachothers.

  The FWPs search for undesirable content with different methods:

  EXTENSION scan searches for undesirable format, especially .MP3 files attract
  attention. Never store .MP3 files on FWPs with .MP3 extension. Some FWPs do
  not allow any .MP3 files, even if you are the musician.

  MANUAL search consists of human "controlsquads" browsing sites, policing for
  unacceptable content.

  SEARCH BOT examines inside archives and webpages for words.

  BYTES/HIT monitor looks for sites with very high amount of bytes transferred
  per hit. This strategy is especially effective against hosting warez on FWP
  servers.

  COMPLAINTS. Offensive sites are likely to generate complaints to the server
  operators, especially at a time of somekind of high profile incident
  involving bombs (Oklahoma city).

FWP specific tips______________________________________________________________

  XOOM [www.xoom.com]
  has somekind of bot scanning your text files, the bot can see inside zips,
  but not inside rars, jars, etc.

  FREESPEECH.ORG [www.freespeech.org]
  tolerates allkinds of legal (under the 1st amendment) expression.

  FSN [www.fsn.net]
  the infamous porn host. Assholish 15 file (per type) and 100kb per file
  limitation, but they don't seem to care, if you have textfiles on illegal
  activities on their servers.

  TIMECITIES [www.timecities.com]
  allows sites with directdownload links to .MP3 files, but you may not host
  the .MP3 files on Timecities space.

  WAREZCITIES [www.warezcities.com]
  allows sites with directdownload links to games and apps, but you may not
  host the disks on Warezcities space.

  GEOCITIES [www.geocities.com]
  is good for hosting warez, because of their FTP support and good speeds.

  WEBJUMP [www.webjump.com]
  offers 25Mb of diskspace.
