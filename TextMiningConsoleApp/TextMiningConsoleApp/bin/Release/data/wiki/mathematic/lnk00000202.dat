(1)  INTRODUCTION

     With Ultra Crack Pro (UCP) in mind, you may be challenged to use it to
it's fullest capability.  Ultra Crack Compiler (UCC) can generate UCP scripts
fast!  Products of UCC can be made into a library of patches in tiny compact
packets, or even made into a gigantic patch library managed by a program!
All products of UCC are royalty free, and free!!!


(2)  PROGRAMMING SCRIPTS

          UC (tm) will assume that the maximum file size is MaxLongInt
     (7FFFFFFFH or 2,147,483,647).  No error checkings are made for the
     actual execution of the scripts.  You may test scripts by manually
     running the scripts and check if it was correctly executed without
     errors.


     ==============================================
       Symbols:  % - used by UCC at compile time.
                 @ - used by script.
     ==============================================


     -----
     %DIR  -  Change directory.
     -----
       Limit:  Maximum 79 characters.

       Notes:  Changes to directory on compile time (ie. if you don't want to
               input path to "open/create" command.  DIR will not change back
               to original directory after compile has completed.

       Example:  (Open "FILE.EXE" in "C:\GAMES" directory).
                 Dir = C:\GAMES
                 Open = FILE.EXE

     ------
     %BKDIR  -  Back to original directory.
     ------
       Notes:  Changes back to the original directory where UCC was called.

       Example:  BKDIR

     -------
     @TITLE  -  Adds a title to the patch file.
     -------
       Limit:  65 characters maximum.

       Example:  Title = A title for everyone to see!

     --------
     @AUTHOR  -  Adds a author name to the patch file.
     --------
       Limit:  65 characters maximum.

       Example:  Author = Any author, group, or company's name here!

     -----
     @MSG  -  Add an extra messege to the patch file.
     -----
       Limit:  65 characters maximum.

       Example:  MSG = Please read the created READ.ME file!!!

     -----
     @DEL  -  Delete file.
     -----
       Limit:  Maximum 79 characters.

       Default:  RErr is off.

       Option:  RErr - report error if unable to delete file.

       Example:  (Delete "JUNK.TXT" and report errors).

                 Del = C:\TEMP\JUNK.TXT, RErr

     ----
     @CD  -  Change directory.
     ----
       Limit:  Maximum 67 characters.

       Default:  RErr is off.

       Option:  RErr - report error if unable to change directory.

       Example:  (Change to "C:\UTIL" and report errors).

                 ChDir = C:\UTIL, RErr

     ----
     @MD  -  Make directory.
     ----
       Limit:  Maximum 67 characters.

       Note:  MD will directories up to 67 character regardless if it already
              exists or not.

       Default:  RErr is off.

       Option:  RErr - report error if unable to make directory.

       Example:  (Make directory "C:\NEW\GAME" and report errors).

                 Md = C:\NEW\GAME, RErr

     -------
     @RD  -  Remove directory.
     -------
       Warnings:  You must perform a "CLOSE" if a file is opened and
                  located the directory to be deleted!!!  Failure to do so
                  will cause DOS to lose the file handle and produce unknown
                  errors!  Also, you must perform a "CD = .." if deleting
                  the directory currently in use, or nothing will happen!

       Limit:  Maximum 67 characters.

       Note:  If RErr is on, then user gets the choice of killing the
              directory and its subdirectories.

       Default:  RErr is off.

       Option:  RErr - report error if unable to remove directory.

                 Rd = C:\NEW, RErr

     ------
     @OPEN  -  Opens a file.

                 ResDT   - restore stored file date/time.
                 ChkSize - check file size
                 ChkCRC  - check file CRC

       Example:  (Open "FILE.EXE" and save file size and CRC).

                 Open = C:\NEW\FILE.EXE, ChkSize, ChkCRC

     --------
     @CREATE  -  Creates a file.
     --------
       Limit:  Maximum 79 characters.

       Notes:  File must be present in the directory specified by "create="
               at compile time.  Be sure that there are enough disk space
               before using the CREATE command!

       Option:  C - LZSS compression (slow compression time)!

       Example:  (Copy file "SAVEGAME.000" and use compression).

                 Create = C:\GAME\SAVEGAME.000, C

     -------
     @CLOSE  -  Close file.
     -------
       Note:  Use only when in cases of extreme emergency!  Ie. Deleting the
              directory where the open file is located.

                 ScanLastPos - Scan from current file position (don't reset
                               file).

       Example:  SM = Caps, ScanLastPos

     -----
     @LOC  - Search by location.
     -----
       Warning:  Don't exceed file size!  Exceeding true file size may
                 produce invalid finds or produce very large files!

       Limits:  Position may not be over MaxLongInt!  Position can't be a
                negative!

       Example:  Loc = 12345678  ; in numerals
                 -or-
                 Loc = $BC614E   ; in hex

     -------
     @SKIPS  - Skip to occurrence number.
     -------
       Note:  Binary search is the default search method if location search
              isn't specified.

       Default:  Finds the first occurrence.

       Example:  (Go to the 10th occurrence).

                 Skip = 10  ; in numerals
                 -or-
                 Skip = $A  ; in hex

     -----
     @JMP  - Jump Ã± bytes from string found position.
     -----
       Warnings:  Jumping to a negative location will produce errors.
                  Jumping further than the current file size will generate a
                  very large file!

       Notes:  If using hex, then you must add "$" to the number.  Also, you
               must realize that it's positive and negative.  Ie. $FF is -1
               and $7F is 127.

       Example:  (Find 1st occurence of "world" in "hello world," jump back
                 6 bytes, and replace with "happy").

                 Jmp = -6
                 F = "world"
                 R = "happy"

     ---
     @F  -  Find string.
     ---
       Limits:  String can't be over 255 characters and all hex digits must
                be even!  If using wildcard mode, all "?" characters are
                regarded as a wildcard! - watch out!

       Note:  Find string always requires a replace string after!

       Syntax:  Default is hex.  Data in double quotes (") are used as
                individual characters; data can also be ASCII characters.
                All "#" and "**" represent wildcards.

       Example:  (Only search for string)

                 F = 0A BA BE " is at the " CA FE
                 R =

                 (Search and replace string)

                 F = 0A BA BE " is at the " CA FE
                 R = 0C BA BE " take the " CA 0B

     ---
     @R  -  Replace string.
     ---
       Limits:  String can't be over 255 characters and all hex digits must
                be even!  If using wildcard mode, all "?" characters are
                regarded as a wildcard! - watch out!

       Note:  Replace string can be used without find string.

       Syntax:  Default is hex.  Data in double quotes (") are used as
                individual characters; data can also be ASCII characters.
                All "#" and "**" represent wildcards.

       Examples:  (Find and replace string)

                  F = 0A BA BE " is at the " CA FE
                  R = 0C BA BE " take the " CA 0B

                  (Replace string at the current location)

                  R = 0A 0B 0C

                  (Replace string at a specific address)

                  Loc = 12345678
                  R = 0A 0B 0C


(3)  COMPILING SCRIPTS

     Format:  UCC.EXE (path)[script](.UC)


     Compiled scripts will be written in the current directory.


     All errors are reported.  However, no logs are made with UCC.  You may
redirect the DOS output to a disk.

     Example:

       C:\> UCC.EXE NEW.UC > UCC.LOG

     UCC.LOG will be produced and you may view the .LOG file using a text
editor or "TYPE UCC.LOG" to view it on the screen.


(4)  TROUBLE SHOOTING

     Because of the vast numbers of errors possible, only tips for good
programming are included in this document.


     General rules for good scripts:

       *  You must have files present and unmodified when compiling!  Check
          if files are in the correct paths.  (Only files listed in open and
          create needs to be present when compiling).

       *  All syntax are entered correctly; ie. valid commands, correct
          lengths, and etc.

       *  All searches end with "R =" replace.  Be sure that if you need to
          find a string, you must include "R =" after.

       *  If changing to different directories either at compile time or
          execution, always keep track of the current directory.  If
          compiling with UCC, use "BkDir" to return to the compiling
          directory.

       *  If you need to report errors while using DEL, CD, MD, and RD, then
          include "RErr" at the end of the command.

          Ie. DEL = C:\JUNK.TXT,RErr

          Also, RD, when appended "RErr," will allow the user to kill
          "deltree" a directory.

       *  Use the error log when testing scripts.

          Format:  UCP.EXE /L[log file] [patch file]

          The default log file UCP.LOG will overwrite existing UCP.LOG in
          the current directory.  Also, you may change the log file name.

          Ie.  UCP.EXE /Lerror.rpt test.crk
