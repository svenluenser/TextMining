The following is a list of currently active USENET newsgroups as of
2 Dec 1996.  This list does not include the gatewayed Internet newsgroups
(see below).  The groups distributed worldwide are divided into eight
broad classifications: "comp", "humanities", "misc", "news", "rec",
"sci", "soc", and "talk".  Each of these classifications is organized
into groups and subgroups according to topic.

"comp"  Topics of interest to both computer professionals and
        hobbyists, including topics in computer science, software
        source, and information on hardware and software systems.

"humanities"
        Professional and amateur topics in the arts & humanities.

"misc"  Groups addressing themes not easily classified under any of the
        other headings or which incorporate themes from multiple
        categories.

"news"  Groups concerned with the news network and software themselves.

"rec"   Groups oriented towards the arts, hobbies and recreational
        activities.

"sci"   Discussions marked by special and usually practical knowledge,
        relating to research in or application of the established
        sciences.

"soc"   Groups primarily addressing social issues and socializing.

"talk"  Groups largely debate-oriented and tending to feature long
        discussions without resolution and without appreciable amounts
        of generally useful information.

These "world" newsgroups are (usually) circulated around the entire
USENET -- this implies world-wide distribution.  Not all groups
actually enjoy such wide distribution, however.  Some sites take only
a selected subset of the more "technical" groups, and controversial
"noise" groups are often not carried by many sites (these groups are
often under the "talk" and "soc" classifications).  Many sites do not
carry some or all of the comp.binaries groups.

There are groups in other subcategories, but they are local: to
institutions, to geographic regions, etc. and they are not listed
here.  Note that these distribution categories can be used to restrict
the propagation of news articles.  Currently, distributions include:
        world           worldwide distribution (default)
        can             limited (mostly) to Canada
        eunet           limited (mostly) to European sites in EUNet
        na              limited (mostly) to North America
        usa             limited (mostly) to the United States
There may be other regional and local distribution categories available
at your site.  Most US states have distribution categories named after
the two letter abbreviation for that state or category (e.g., "ga" for
Georgia, "nj" for New Jersey). Please use an appropriate distribution
category if your article is not likely to be of interest to USENET
readers worldwide.

Please notify me of any errors or changes to the information in
this article.
