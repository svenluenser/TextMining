Introduction
------------
Puffer is a general purpose encryption tool for Windows that protects your
personal and business data as well as your e-mail correspondence.  Use
Puffer to securely exchange data over insecure channels.  Puffer uses
state-of-the-art encryption algorithms for maximum security.  This shareware
version has been approved for export from the U.S. by the State Department
through a commodity jurisdiction determination.

Features:

* 40-bit PC1 (RC4 clone) stream cipher
* 160-bit Blowfish block cipher (U.S./Canada registered version)
* Secure, multi-pass file wiping
* LZ77 compression
* Binary and ASCII archives
* Self-extracting executables
* Built-in editor


Installation
------------
Puffer is normally distributed inside a ZIP archive through online services.
Unzip the distribution files into a temporary directory.  Run the SETUP.EXE
program from the Windows Program Manager by selecting File/Run.  The setup
program will prompt you for a destination directory (C:\PUFFER2 is default)
and will create a Puffer2 program group.  You may remove the files from
the temporary directory after the installation is complete.
