Private Idaho version 2.5b4 (beta) 9/20/95 - Freeware
copyright (c)1995, Joel McNamara (joelm@eskimo.com)

What it does
------------
Private Idaho makes private e-mail easier.  It simplifies using
PGP and various anonymous remailers.  You can send e-mail messages
with it (if you have access to a SMTP mail server) or you can use
it in conjunction with many Windows e-mail applications.

PGP is fairly well known.  Remailers are getting increased exposure,
but are still not widely used.  If you use PGP, they are worth
knowing and learning about.  For a good introduction, refer to:

http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html

What it doesn't do
------------------
Private Idaho isn't full featured e-mail software.  It doesn't support
many options a package like Eudora or Pegasus does (including receiving
mail).  It is meant to be a simple, easy to use tool for sending secure
e-mail.

Private Idaho doesn't automatically keep track of which remailers
are active.  You'll need to manually keep the text file updated to
stay current.  See the "Updating remailer and USENET info" section below.

Private Idaho isn't a "complete" PGP shell.  It's designed to make
sending private e-mail easier and incorporates the basic PGP features
for doing so.

Requirements
------------
Microsoft Windows 3.x
Visual Basic runtime file (VBRUN300.DLL - not included, most sites
  such as simtel have this, if you can't find it, try ftp.microsoft.com)
A Windows e-mail package (Eudora, MS Mail, Pegasus, etc.) - optional
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy - 2.6.2 is the latest MIT version - if you're
   using the commercial ViaCrypt Windows version, see following section on
   Using ViaCrypt PGP.)

Where to Get It:
----------------
Latest releases of Private Idaho are available from:

ftp.eskimo.com /u/j/joelm
http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm (plus additional computer privacy info)

Mirror sites for the latest release include:

http://miso.wwa.com/~dochobbs
ftp.empire.net/pub/WINDOWS/Utils
ftp.cts.com/pub/jrcffmn
ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/pgp/pc

Installing Private Idaho:
-------------------------
Copy the following files to the directory that contains PGP:

PIDAHO.EXE      the application
CPMAILER.TXT    remailer list
RMINFO.TXT      remailer info list
RMKEYS.TXT      recent remailer PGP keys
USENET.TXT      list of mail to USENET newsgroup gateways
EMAIL.TXT       list of e-mail software settings
URLS.TXT        list of Web URLs
WEB.TXT         Web browser info
PIDAHO.TXT      this file
PIPGP.PIF       for easy shelling to DOS PGP
PIPGPX.PIF      shell and autoclose

(Note: You can copy the files to a separate directory if you wish.
I only suggest copying to the PGP directory, because a few users have
experienced odd path problems.  In any case, be sure the PGPPATH
variable is set in AUTOEXEC.BAT, as well the PATH variable points
to the PGP directory, and the directory containing Private Idaho if
it is installed elsewhere.)

Copy the following file to the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory:

CMDIALOG.VBX    common dialog control
IPPORT.VBX      TCP/IP control
IPPORT.LIC      TCP/IP support file

(You don't need to replace these files if they already exist).

Add PIDAHO.EXE to a Windows program group of your choice.

When you run Private Idaho for the first time, it will prompt you
for configuration information (to be saved in the PIDAHO.INI file).
You will only need to go through this process once.  The steps
are fairly self-explanatory.  PIDAHO.INI is written to the
C:\WINDOWS directory.

Before running Private Idaho for the first time, have your e-mail
software running, with a blank, new message window open.  You may
need this to provide Private Idaho with configuration information.

Updating remailer and USENET info:
----------------------------------
Remailers and USENET mail gateways come and go and vary in reliability.
There are three files that come with Private Idaho that contain remailer
and USENET information.

CPMAILER.TXT contains remailer names with latency and "up-time"
statistics.

RMINFO.TXT contains remailer names with a description of their
features (i.e. supports PGP, cutmarks, etc.).

USENET.TXT contains mail to USENET newsgroup gateways.

The remailer information is derived from Raph Levien's anonymous remailer
"pinging" service.  The USENET information comes from Matt Ghio's
remailer info service.

To make sure you have the most current remailer information, you'll
need to manually update the CPMAILER, RMINFO, and USENET files.  This
simply consists of getting the latest information, and pasting it over
the old file contents.

You can get the most current remailer information by:

        finger remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu

        or

        http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html

        or

        E-mailing skaplin@c2.org with the subject:

                SEND FILE remailer-ping

        The list updates every 15 minutes at 1, 16, 31, 46 past the hour.

You can get the most current USENET gateway information (as well
as additional remailer info such as PGP keys) by:

        E-mailing mg5n+remailers@andrew.cmu.edu
        (no subject or text in the message body required)

Look at the file contents before you replace it.  You should be able to
directly copy the information you need and paste it.  (The exception is
the RMINFO file.  You'll need to manually edit the first line, which
contains a date for how current the information is.)

Installing the remailer PGP public keys:
----------------------------------------
With Private Idaho you can easily send encrypted mail to certain
remailers, using their public keys.  The ciphertext is decrypted when
received, and then sent on to the next destination.

The file RMKEYS.TXT contains copies of remailer PGP keys.  Use the
"Export message" command in Private Idaho's File menu to read the file
into the message area.  Then use the "Add key from message" command in
the PGP menu.  All of the keys will be added to your key ring.  If you
already have some of these keys installed, PGP will skip them and only
install new ones.

Specifying e-mail information:
------------------------------
If you use an Internet provider that supports sending e-mail through a
SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) mail server, the most commonly
used type, you can send messages directly from Private Idaho without
using another e-mail application.

To do so, you need to enter some setup information when Private Idaho
is first run.  This includes:

Your e-mail address - i.e. joelm@eskimo.com
Your real name - i.e. Joel McNamara
Your SMTP server name - i.e. mail.eskimo.com

You can get these settings from the current e-mail software you are
running.  These settings can be changed with the Options command in
Private Idaho's File menu.

NOTE: The POP server information is currently not used, but likely
will be in a future release.

To use an address book:
-----------------------
When Private Idaho is first run, it prompts you if you want to use an
address book.  This is simply a text file, with each line containing an
e-mail address (if you use Eudora, you can use the RCPDBASE.TXT file).
These addresses appear in the To: combo list.

You can also specify an address file later, by using the Options command
in the File menu.

If you change the file, you'll need to restart Private Idaho for the
names in the address book to appear in the To: line.

To use OS/2 delay:
------------------
Another option in the Options dialog box is the "Use OS/2
delay" checkbox.  Some versions of OS/2 may run the shelled DOS PGP
process and Private Idaho simultaneously, causing errors (for example,
PGP isn't through encrypting a file, but Private Idaho decides to
display it).  If this box is checked, Private Idaho will pause and display
a dialog box.  When PGP has completed its processing, click the "Resume"
button to continue.

If you are running OS/2, you may (or may not) need to check this option.
If you are running Windows (by itself), make sure this option is not
checked.

To encrypt a message:
---------------------
1. Enter the e-mail address of the person you want to send the
   encrypted message to.  (Since most people will use their e-mail
   address as part of their PGP user ID, Private Idaho will search
   through the public key ring looking for a match.  If it finds
   a match, it will encrypt off of that key.  If it can't find a
   match, user IDs in the public key ring are displayed, and you
   select one.)

2. Compose the message you want to encrypt in the message box.

3. Choose the "Encrypt message" command from the PGP menu.

Private Idaho will create a temporary file containing the message,
shell out to PGP and encrypt the file with ASCII armor, copy the
encrypted text to the message box, and delete the temporary file
with the PGP wipe command (yes, wipe only performs a single pass
at overwriting the data before deleting, if you need more security,
try a shareware memory resident app called Real Delete).

To encrypt and sign a message:
------------------------------
Same as encrypting a message (only you choose the "Encrypt and sign
message" command from the PGP menu).

To sign a message:
------------------
Same steps as encrypting a message (only you choose the "Clear sign
message" command from the PGP menu).  This adds your signature to the
text contained in the message box.  The text is not encrypted.

Important Note: Some e-mail packages (notably Eudora), hard code
carriage return/line feeds when mail is sent and Word Wrap is turned
on.  This means if you sign and message, the signature will be
invalid when the receiver gets it, because CR/LFs have been added.  I've
found most e-mail software is pretty smart these days, and will auto-
matically wrap lines without CR/LFs.  Consider turning Word Wrap off
if you have this problem with clear signing.

To decrypt a message:
---------------------
1. Paste the encrypted message you received to the message box.

2. Choose the "Decrypt message" command from the PGP menu.  You
   will be prompted for your passphrase.

Private Idaho will create a temporary file containing the message,
shell out to PGP and decrypt the file, copy the decrypted text to the
message box, and delete the temporary file with the PGP wipe command.

To import or export a message:
------------------------------
The "Import message" command in the File menu reads a text file from
disk into the message box.

The "Export message" command saves the contents of the message box
to a text file on disk.

To use a header or signature (sig) in a message:
------------------------------------------------
You can store frequently used headers and signatures and insert them
directly into messages composed with Private Idaho.

Headers could be:

X-Anon-Password: <whatever>
X-Anon-To: <the addressee>

Such as those used with the anon.penet.fi remailer.

Signatures are text with your name, e-mail address, and other
information.

Choose the Options command in the Edit menu to enter a header and
signature.  These are saved to the HEADER.TXT and SIG.TXT files in
the Private Idaho directory.

Once entered, the header/signature can be inserted into the message
text box with the Insert header and/or Insert signature commands in
the Edit menu.

Note: A header with a password or a signature used in the wrong place
can compromise the security of your e-mail.  Please use these features
carefully.

To use "Use multiple keys":
---------------------------
This option encrypts your message with multiple keys.  When it is
checked, a dialog box will prompt you to enter which keys to
encrypt the message with.  The List button will display a list of
keys in your public ring.  Use the List button to specify one key at
a time.

You can also manually enter full or partial user IDs, with each ID
separated by a space.

Multiple user IDs will be inserted in the To: line.  If the creator
of the key has followed standard PGP conventions, these will be
"mailable" e-mail addresses.

To use "Encrypt to self":
-------------------------
This option encrypts the message with your own key in addition
to the key of the person you are sending the message to.  PGP
can encrypt a message with a multiple number of keys.  This
effectively makes the message decipherable by the person you
are sending it to and yourself.

This feature is handy for archiving encrypted messages you have
sent.  You will need to provide your secret passphrase in order
to decrypt any messages "encrypted to self."

To use "Eyes only":
-------------------
This option sets a flag in an encrypted message so when it is
decrypted, the contents will only be displayed in the DOS box, and
not saved to disk.  Although there are ways to get around this,
the idea is to use this option if you're concerned about someone
you send an encrypted message to, leaving the decrypted text file
somewhere that could be compromised.

If you use Private Idaho and get an "Eyes only" message, decrypted
text will not be placed in the message box.  After it is displayed in
the PGP DOS box, an error message will appear stating a file could not
be found and the decryption couldn't take place.  This is normal.

To use "Conventional encrypt":
------------------------------
When "Conventional encrypt" is checked, Private Idaho instructs PGP
to use conventional versus public key encryption on a file or a message.
This encryption relies on a single passphrase to encrypt and decrypt
the information.

To use "Obscurity":
-------------------
When PGP encrypts text with ASCII armor on (almost required for
sending e-mail), it adds a header that identifies the message as
being PGP encrypted.  This obviously clues anyone in to the fact
that the message is encrypted.  There are times when a user might
not want a message to be obviously identified as encrypted.

When Obscurity is checked, Private Idaho will strip off the
identifying PGP text headers when a message is encrypted.  It will also
add the headers before it calls PGP to decrypt ciphertext in the
message text box.

Obviously, the sender and receiver of the e-mail are both going
to need to be using Private Idaho and know they need to have
"obscurity" turned on.

To use "File as input":
-----------------------
When "File as input" is checked, Private Idaho uses a file versus
the contents of the message box as the source to encrypt or decrypt.
You'll notice the encrypt/decrypt menu items display "file" instead
of "message" when this option is checked.

You will be prompted to supply the filename to encrypt/decrypt.
File are encrypted with ASCII armor (to allow easy attachment in
mail), and tagged with an .ASC extension.  The plaintext file is not
deleted or wiped after encryption.  The file will be encrypted with
the key in the To: line.  The "Encrypt to self," "Eyes only," and
"Obscurity" options are not used, even though they may be checked.

This option is useful if you have a message over 32k that is over
Private Idaho's maximum message box size.

To add a key contained in a message to your public ring:
--------------------------------------------------------
If the message box contains someone's PGP public key that they
mailed it to you, the "Add key from message" command in the PGP
menu will add any key(s) in the message to your public ring and update
the PUBKEYS.OUT file.

To delete a key:
----------------
You can delete keys from your public key ring.  To do so:

1.  Choose the "Delete key" command in the PGP menu.
2.  Select which public key to delete from the user ID list.

PGP will remove this key from your key ring and update the PUBKEYS.OUT
file.

To insert a public key in your message:
---------------------------------------
There are times when you'll likely want to send someone your public
key so you can exchange messages.  You can easily do this by:

1.  Choosing the "Insert key in message" command in the PGP menu.
2.  Selecting the public key (from a list of user IDs) you want to insert.

This extracts a key from your public key ring, and inserts it at the
cursor in the message text box.

To update Private Idaho's public key ring information:
------------------------------------------------------
When you first run Private Idaho, it copies information from your
public key ring to a text file named PUBKEYS.OUT.  If you add or
delete keys from PGP or another shell, you need to update the file.
To do so:

1. Choose the "Update public key ring" command from the PGP menu.

The PUBKEYS.OUT file should always be in the same directory as
Private Idaho.

You don't need to use this command if you add or delete keys from
within Private Idaho.

To control the behavior of the PGP DOS box:
-------------------------------------------
When encrypting and decrypting, Private Idaho needs to shell out to
the DOS version of PGP.  You can control the appearance of the DOS box and
its behavior with the "Run PGP minimized" and "Auto-close PGP" commands.

When "Run PGP minimized" is checked, the iconized window is displayed
at the bottom of the screen when PGP is run.  When this option is
not checked, the full-screen, Windows DOS box is displayed.

When "Auto-close PGP" is checked, the PGP DOS box is automatically
closed when PGP finishes running.  When the option is not checked, you
must manually close the window when PGP is done running.

These features are useful for viewing PGP diagnostic messages.

To set PGP options:
-------------------
1. Choose the "Options..." command from the PGP menu.

The PGP path (which is extracted from the PGPPATH environment variable,
which you should have set if you followed the PGP installation
instructions) is the directory path where the PGP .EXE is located.

Your PGP user ID is just that.  You can use the entire user ID
(i.e. Joel McNamara <joelm@eskimo.com>) or a portion of it.  You are
prompted for this when Private Idaho starts.

There is also a temporary file name.  This is the file Private Idaho
uses when encrypting and decrypting text from the clipboard.  PIDAHO
is the default, and you should leave that setting unless you have
any name conflicts (which you shouldn't).  Temporary files are written
and deleted/wiped from the PGP directory.  Do not add a file extension
to the temporary name.

You can specify a full path for the temp file (i.e. e:\temp\pidaho).
This is provided for users who want the additional security of having
their temp files written to a RAM disk.  If a full path is specified,
that directory is used.

The "Use ViaCrypt Windows version" should be checked if you are using
the commercial release of PGP sold by ViaCrypt.  (See the following
section.)

If you want to use key rings that are located somewhere other than the
default PGP directory, you can specify their location in PGP's CONFIG.TXT
file.  See the PGP documentation for details on this.

Using ViaCrypt PGP
------------------
There has been some demand for Private Idaho to work with ViaCrypt's
commercial version of PGP for Windows.  First a little background.

What ViaCrypt has done, is compile PGP in a Windows shell (vpgpqw.exe).
Private Idaho normally assumes the user has DOS PGP, and shells out DOS
commands through a PIF file.  Needless to say, this won't work with the PGP
Windows shell.

If you use ViaCrypt PGP for Windows, be sure the "Use ViaCrypt Windows
version" option is checked in the PGP Options dialog.

Unfortunately, Private Idaho doesn't interact as seamlessly with the
ViaCrypt Windows version as it does with the more common DOS versions.
Some slight functionality is lost, including:

You will need to manually create and update the PUBKEYS.OUT text file.
The first time you run Private Idaho you will be prompted to use the Notepad
(or another editor) to create a file named PUBKEYS.OUT.  Save it in the same
directory as PGP.  Next, the ViaCrypt dialog will appear, and list all of
the public keys.  Copy everything in this dialog box, starting with the
"Key ring: 'i:\pgp26\pubring.pgp'" (or however it appears on your machine)
line and ending with the "28 matching keys found." line.

For example, the text would look something like this:

Key ring: 'i:\pgp26\pubring.pgp'
Type bits/keyID    Date       User ID
pub  1024/2627B761 1995/02/26 Bonafide remailer <remailer@bonafide.jpunix.com>
28 matching keys found.

Save this as PUBKEYS.OUT before you use Private Idaho.  Anytime you add new
public keys to your key ring, you'll need to go through this process again.
The "Update public key ring" command in Private Idaho will walk you through
the steps.

The other thing is the "Run PGP minimized" and "Auto-close PGP" commands are
dimmed out.  Since these apply to DOS PIF files, they really don't have an
impact on ViaCrypt.

Other than that, Private Idaho should be completely functional (this has
been tested with version 2.7.1 of ViaCrypt PGP for Windows).

Sending mail:
-------------
If your Internet provider uses a SMTP mail server, you can send e-mail
directly from Private Idaho.

Before running Private Idaho, you should have a Winsock connection to
your Internet provider.  Otherwise, don't run Private Idaho first, then
connect to your Internet provider.  (You can still use Private Idaho to
work off-line though.)

To send a message, make sure the proper "to:" mail address is specified
and either click the Send button above the message text or use the
"Send message" command in the E-mail menu.

When mail is sent, the text next to the Send button is updated, showing
the mail server communication status.  This is the actual SMTP conversation
between your computer and the mail server (you don't have to do anything,
just watch).  Any errors should be displayed on this line.

Mail sent directly from Private Idaho is currently limited to the size
of the text box (roughly 32K).  Attachments are not supported.

Server communication can be a little tricky.  If you get errors while
trying to send a message to your mail server, change the ServerDelay
setting in PIDAHO.INI to a longer duration (the default is 2 seconds),
and restart Private Idaho.

If you use Private Idaho with a non-SMTP mail server or wish to use a
full-featured e-mailer, you can use the Transfer commands in the E-mail
menu to transfer a composed message back to your primary e-mailer for
sending.

Note: When Private Idaho is loaded, its TCP/IP custom control issues a
WSAStartup call to winsock.dll.  Some Winsock stacks (such as Trumpet's
TCPMAN) will automatically start when this call is made, other stacks will
not.  If your stack starts up and supports automatic login, and you
frequently use Private Idaho off-line, turn the automatic login option
in the stack off.  This will prevent the stack from trying to dial your
Internet provider when you run Private Idaho.  The Winsock stack can
be run without being connected to your Internet provider.  If you work
off-line, you may need to exit the Winsock stack when you finish with
Private Idaho (although some stacks, such as TCPMAN, will close
automatically after you exit Private Idaho).  The above applies to SLIP
connections.  There have been reports of problems trying to use the Trumpet
stack off-line when a PPP connection is specified.  Im planning on resolving
the off-line problems in the near future with a maintenance release.

To send mail through one anonymous remailer:
--------------------------------------------
You have a choice of different types of remailers to use.  They include:

        Cypherpunk - the largest category of remailers.

        Eric - another type of remailer (i.e. "soda" - csua.berkeley.edu)

        Anon.penet.fi - Julf's remailer in Finland.  Very popular on
        USENET newsgroups.  You need to get a free account before using,
        which people will be able to reply back to your anonymous mail.

I really don't want to get into the differences between the various
types or make suggestions on which to use.

See: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html for some good
information sources on remailers.

1. Check which type of remailer to use in the Remailers menu.

2. Compose the message and specify who you want to send the mail to
   in the To: line.

3. Select a remailer from the Remailer: combo list.

3. Choose the "Append info to message" command from the E-mail menu.

The appropriate remailer instructions are added to the contents of the
message box.

If you are using a SMTP mail server, you can click the Send button or
use the "Send message" command in the E-mail menu.

If you are using another e-mailer, the "Transfer to other e-mailer"
command in the E-mail menu moves the message to your e-mailer.  The
"Append and Send/Transfer" commands appends and sends/transfers in one
menu selection.

You'll notice the words "latency" and "up time."  Press the "?" button
next to the remailer combo box for definitions.  This information is
useful for deciding which remailer to use.

To chain a message (send it through multiple remailers):
--------------------------------------------------------
This option currently only works with Cypherpunk-type remailers
(although you could chain to anon.penet.fi as your final destination if
its address is specified in the To: line).

1. Follow the same steps as above, but choose "chain" from the Remailer:
   combo list box.

3. Choose the "Append info to message" command from the Transfer menu.

3. A list of remailers is displayed.  Select the ones you wish to chain.
   You can choose the order you wish to chain the remailers.

The appropriate remailer instructions are added to the contents of the
message box.

To encrypt mail and send it through an anonymous mailer:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Encrypt the message first.

2. Select the appropriate remailer(s) and choose the "Append info to
   message" command from the E-mail menu.

If you don't follow this order, you'll end up encrypting the remailer
instructions.  The remailers are smart, but not that smart.

To use Cypherpunk remailer advanced features:
---------------------------------------------
The Cypherpunk remailers offer some advanced features to enhance
e-mail privacy.  When the "Cypherpunk" option is checked in the Remailers
menu, the "Advanced Cypherpunk" cascading menu item is available.

By checking one of the options, it filters the remailers in Remailer
list box.  For example, if you check the "Use latent time" option, only
Cypherpunk remailers that support the latent time option will be
displayed in the list box.  If no options are checked, all Cypherpunk
remailers are displayed.

Select advanced options, then select which remailers to use.  (Each time
an option is checked or unchecked, the list is reset, and the default
value is "none.")

Here is a brief summary of the different features:

        Encrypt to remailer(s)
        ----------------------
These remailers have PGP public keys.  If you send mail encrypted
with their key to them, they will automatically decrypt the mail and
pass the decrypted message to the next destination.  This is a fairly
secure form of communication, since there is no plaintext transmitted
to the remailer.

When this option is checked, the text in the message box will be
encrypted with the selected remailer(s)' key.

You must first add the remailer keys to your public key ring.  See the
installation section at the beginning of this file.

You can also chain remailers with this option.  Each text block will be
encrypted with the appropriate remailer's key.  This was a fairly tedious
task to do by hand, but Private Idaho completely automates the process.

Keep in mind this level of encryption is totally separate from you
encrypting a message to an individual.

        Replace subject
        ---------------
The "Replace subject" option removes the subject on the To: line, and
adds a user-selected subject to final mail destination.  This is useful
if you really don't want someone to guess the contents of the mail by
the subject line.

A dialog box will prompt you for the subject title.

        Use latent time
        ---------------
The "Use latent time" option instructs the remailer to delay sending
the message after some set period of time.  This is useful if you
suspect traffic analysis is taking place (watching the flow of messages
to and from you).

A dialog box will prompt you for the amount of delay.

You can either specify a local time for the mail to be sent (in 24 hour
clock format).  For example, entering 18:00 would instruct the remailer
to send the message at 6:00 PM, the local time of the remailer.  (Don't add
AM or PM.)

You can also specify a set number of hours and minutes after the mail
is received.  For example, entering +10:30, would delay sending the
message 10 hours, 30 minutes after it was received by remailer.  You
can enter values of up to 24 hours.

If you are chaining remailers and use the latent time option, the same
value will be used for all remailers.  A future version will allow you
to enter unique time values for each remailer.

        Use cutmarks
        ------------
Some e-mail packages automatically attach a signature (sig) to the bottom
of each sent message.  This obviously reduces the anonymous nature of
using a remailer.

When the "Use cutmarks" option is checked, the remailer will search for
a line beginning with a certain character string.  It will remove that
line, and all subsequent lines.  For example, if you specify the cutmarks
to be "--", the line containing "-----------------------" and any lines
after it, would be stripped from the message.

You specify the cutmarks string in a dialog box.

If you are chaining remailers, cutmarks will only be removed from the
message received by the first remailer.  This is because a message
composed in Private Idaho will not have any sigs attached to it.

NOTE:  Be careful of using cutmarks with encrypted messages.  PGP
encrypted messages start with "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----", so if you
used "---" as the cutmark, your message would be removed.

        Post to USENET
        --------------
Some remailers can post anonymously to USENET newsgroups.  When this
option is selected, a list of remailers that support this feature is
displayed in the remailer list.  Read the next section for how to
post anonymous messages to newsgroups.

To post anonymously to a USENET newsgroup through a remailer:
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Enter the name of the newsgroup you want to post to in the To: combo
   box (i.e. alt.2600).

2. Enter the subject and message.

3. If you are posting through the Anon.penet.fi or Eric remailers, you'll
   need to make sure the remailer is checked in the Newsgroup menu.

   If you are using a Cypherpunk remailer, select the "Post to USENET"
   option in the "Advanced Cypherpunk" cascading menu.  (You can also
   choose the Encrypt and Subject options to further enhance privacy.)

4. Select the remailer you want to send the message through.

5. Choose the "Append info to message" command from the "E-mail"
   menu.

6. If you'd like to chain your post, select which Cypherpunk style
   remailers to use and choose "Append info to message" again.

To post anonymously to a USENET newsgroup through a gateway:
------------------------------------------------------------
USENET gateways are mail servers that support posting to USENET groups
through e-mail messages.  To post through a gateway with a Cypherpunk
style remailer:

1. Enter the name of the newsgroup you want to post to in the To: combo
   box (i.e. alt.2600).

2. Enter the subject and message.

3. Select the "E-mail gateway" option in the Newsgroups menu.  If you select
   None, specific information needed to create a newsgroup posting will not
   be added.

4. Select a remailer (or "chain") from Remailer: combo box.

5. Choose the "Append info to message" command from the "E-mail"
   menu.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Sending an e-mail message to one of the USENET gateways
will not anonymize the mail.  You must send it through a remailer
first.  Please test by sending mail to someplace like alt.test
before doing it for real.

Not all USENET gateways support all newsgroups.  You may have to try
several to find one that supports the groups you want to post to.

To transfer a message to your e-mail software:
----------------------------------------------
1. Make sure the e-mail software (Eudora, MS Mail, etc.) is running, a
   blank, new message in the e-mail software is in front, and the cursor
   is on the To: line.  Do not minimize/iconize the e-mail application.

2. In the Private Idaho "E-mail" menu, choose the "Transfer to other
   e-mailer" command.

This transfers the address information and message contents you entered
in Private Idaho to your e-mail software.

If you don't have the new message window open or the cursor is somewhere
other than the To: line, Private Idaho will happily try to paste the data
in whatever e-mailer window is active.

Changing e-mail transfer settings:
----------------------------------
The Transfer Options command in the E-mail menu contains the settings
used to transfer a message from Private Idaho to the e-mail software you
are using.  This information must be correct for a valid transfer to take
place.

The information in the dialog is fairly self-explanatory.  Make sure your
e-mail application is running before you run Private Idaho.  You may
need to experiment with which window to transfer to.  Use your common
sense in selecting a window name from the list.

If your e-mail application doesn't support sequentially tabbing through
headers (such as Free Agent or Netscape), you'll need to write a simple
script to transfer the message information.

The script language has the following commands:

to - to: header line
from - from: header line
subject - subject: header line
cc - cc: header line
bcc - bcc: header line
msg - text in the message window
t - Tab
sh - Shift+Tab
e - Enter

Each of the commands instructs Private Idaho what information or key
should be sent to the e-mail application.  (Header lines are automatically
sent with a following Tab.)

Each command (with the exception of the last command), should be followed
by a comma.

Run your e-mail application and list the key sequences required to transfer
the information.  (Remember, the cursor should always start on the first
line/item of the new message window.)

For example, if you were using Free Agent, the following script would
correctly transfer your e-mail from Private Idaho:

to,subject,t,t,t,t,t,t,t,t,msg


This file provides information on Private Idaho's support of Community
ConneXion's (c2.org) anonymous, return mail address service.  This is
preliminary documentation released with the beta version.  Expanded information
will appear in a revision of the Private Idaho online and text documentation
files.


What is a nym?
--------------
Nym is simply another term for an alias or pseudonym.  Community ConneXion
(http://www.c2.org) is a privacy-oriented Internet provider that is
currently offering  a no-charge service that allows you to create a nym
account (where e-mail can securely be forwarded to you).

This is similar to setting up an anon.penet.fi account, only much more
secure.  Instead of using a data base of users associated with account names
(like penet.fi), the service works by rerouting through remailers and
conventionally encrypting messages forwarded to you with PGP.

Briefly, you supply the nym server with a chain of remailers (PGP encrypted
being the most secure), you'd like to use to have any messages forwarded to
you.  You also provide a nym account name and a PGP passphrase to encrypt
the forwarded message.

For example, if you selected "casper" as a nym, you could send anonymous
e-mail or post anonymously to a USENET newsgroup and have people reply to
casper@alpha.c2.org.  When someone sends a message to that address, it
is PGP encrypted, then sent through a series of remailers you specified.
It is eventually forwarded to you through the remailers.  You'd then
use Private Idaho to decrypt the message.

Once you have an account, you can also send mail or post articles from
alias@alpha.c2.org.  In such cases, your nym account name would appear in
the From: line of the message/article.


     Creating a nym account:
     -----------------------
Creating a nym account was a bit complex, but Private Idaho has simplified
the process.  Just select "Create alpha.c2.org nym" from the Nym menu
and follow the instructions in the dialog boxes.

Before starting, make sure you have a copy of the nym server key in your
public ring.  Here's the key (you can use Private Idaho to insert it).
Its also provided in the RMKEYS.TXT file.

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6

=xmQf
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Private Idaho will step you through the entire account request process,
and when you're through, you can send the message to alias@alpha.c2.org.

If you were successful, you'll receive an encrypted confirmation message
back.

After you receive confirmation, send mail to your new nym account to
test it.  Remember, response time may vary.


     Changing your nym password:
     ---------------------------
You can change your nym account password with this menu item.  The command
pastes a template in the message window.  Simply enter your current
password and a new password in the message.  Encrypt the message and send
to alias@alpha.c2.org.  If you don't provide a value for New-Password, the
account will be deleted.  You can also change mail routing with this command.
First specify the remailer routing (put your e-mail address on the To: line,
select a chain of remailers, and use the "Append info to message" menu item),
then select Change nym password to append the password change information to the
routing message.


     Preparing nym message:
     ----------------------
To send a message through alias@alpha.c2.org, first compose your message in
Private Idaho's message window.  If you are sending e-mail, put the address on
the To: line.  If you are posting to a newsgroup, enter the USENET gateway
on the To: line.  Select the "Prepare nym message" item from the Nym menu.
Now fill in your nym password and the Subject: lines.  Select the "Encrypt
nym message" menu item and send the message.


     Encrypting the nym message:
     ---------------------------
All messages sent to alias@alpha.c2.org must be encrypted with the nym server
key.  Any plaintext messages will not be processed and be deleted.  As a
reminder, whenever you prepare a message to send to the nym server, Private
Idaho displays a red encryption reminder above the message window.  After you
encrypt the message, the message disappears (you can also click on the reminder
message to make it disappear).


     Nym Notes:
     ----------
Private Idaho stores the nym and expanded nym of the last nym account created
in the PIDAHO.INI file.  The password is not stored for security reasons.

Your nym passphrase should be different than your everyday PGP passphrase.  You
are compromising your security if they are the same.

Make sure the nym passphrase does not have any spaces in it.  The server will
truncate the passphrase at the space.

If you have questions/comments about the Private Idaho interface to
alias@alpha.c2.org send e-mail to joelm@eskimo.com.  If you have comments or
questions about the nym server, send e-mail to admin@alpha.c2.org.  You can
get additional information about the nym server by sending mail to
help@alpha.c2.org.


To access a Web browser:
------------------------
One of the main purposes of Private Idaho is to provide an
easy environment that encourages people to use PGP and
remailers with their e-mail.  The more people that use these
tools, the less likely it is governments will be able to
take them away.

The Worldwide Web is becoming an increasingly important means
of distributing information around the world.  There are a
number of free, important electronic information sources and
services that reside on the Web.

If you use a Web browser, Private Idaho can interact with
your browser to provide links to sources where you can access
tools and information to increase your electronic privacy.

     Using the Web menu:
     -------------------
The Web menu comes with a series of menu items I feel are
important if you use Private Idaho.  Each menu item corresponds to
a Web link (or technically a URL - universal resource locator).
When you select the menu item, Private Idaho will load (if necessary)
and activate your Web browser.  It will then pass commands on to
your browser to go to that particular URL.

Private Idaho's default settings assume you use Netscape as a
browser (located in c:/netscape/netscape.exe).  If you don't use
Netscape, or if you do and it is located in a different path, see
the "Configuring Private Idaho for your Web browser" section below.

Obviously, you must be connected to the Internet for a browser to
display a Web page.

If your browser is not running, Private Idaho will inform you and
then load it.  Once the browser is running, select the menu item
again, so the information will be passed on the the browser.

     Default menu items:
     -------------------
Here are the default menu items that come with Private Idaho.  I
encourage you to spend some time exploring them, particularly the
sites for the EFF, EPIC, and CPSR organizations.  They contain a
wealth of information on cryptography, privacy, and government
issues.

You can also add your own menu items and links. See the "Adding your own links
to the Web menu" section below.

     Configuring Private Idaho for your Web browser:
     -----------------------------------------------
As previously stated, Private Idaho's default Web browser configuration
is Netscape.  To configure to your own browser, choose the Options
command from the Web menu.

This dialog box may look complex, but really isn't.  First, a little
background on what happens when you select a menu item from the Web
menu.

Private Idaho interacts with a browser by sending a key sequence to it,
much in the same way it works when you transfer information to your
e-mail software.  While some browsers like Netscape support DDE, I
wanted to provide more flexibility for use with other browsers that
didn't.

When you select a menu item, it looks to see if the browser is running
by seeing if a window exists in the Windows task list.  (If the
browser isn't running, it will attempt to load it, and ask you to
select the menu item again after the browser has loaded.)

If a window is present, it sends a series of keys that tells the
browser to provide some form of input for specifying a URL.  For
example in Netscape, the CTRL+L key opens a dialog box for a URL to
be entered.  Next, Private Idaho sends the actual URL that corresponds
to the menu item to the browser, plus a key sequence that tells it
to go to the URL (in Netscape's case, the return/enter key).

With that in mind, here's information on the parameters in the Web
Options dialog box.

Web browser path - Enter the full path of the Web browser you use,
for example, c:/netscape/netscape.exe (which is the default).

Browser window search string - This is the name of the window that
Private Idaho will pass the key sequences to.  Depending on the browser,
you can just put its name here.  (HINT:  Run the browser then select
the Options command in Private Idaho's Transfer menu to get a list of
all of the current window names.  Use the name that corresponds to the
browser.)

Here's where things can get a little tricky. Some browsers (such as Netscape)
use a parent window and a child window.  If you specify the parent window
(named "Netscape") to pass the key sequences to, nothing will happen.  This
is because the child window (that's name contains the current URL) is active,
and receives any key messages.  The problem with browsers like this, is
the window name constantly changes, so you never know which window to send
the key sequence to.

The solution is to look for a command pattern that all child window names
have.  In Netscape's case, child windows names always start with
"Netscape - [", so if you specify this as the Browser window search string,
Private Idaho will always be able to activate the correct window.

You may need to do some experimenting with this, to find the correct
search string to use.  The window list in the Transfer Options dialog
can help.

Key sequence to prompt for URL - This is a series of keyboard commands
within the browser that allows the user to enter a URL.  For example,
typing CTRL+L in Netscape brings up a URL dialog box.  You will need
to enter the key sequence that is appropriate for your browser.

Certain keys must use special characters.

For the Ctrl key use a ^
For the Alt key use a %
For a tab use {TAB}
For a return/enter use ~
For the Shift key use a +
For keys to be held down at the same time, enclose then with ( )

For example:

In Netscape a CTRL+L opens the URL dialog box so you'd enter ^l

Key sequence to get URL - This is the key sequence that will tell the
browser to go to the URL.  In Netscape, pressing the return/enter key
after the URL has been entered closes the dialog box and goes to the
URL.  So, for this parameter you would use a ~

(The corresponding special keys shown above also apply to this
parameter.)

All parameters are written to the PIDAHO.INI file when you click the
OK button.

     Adding your own links to the Web menu:
     --------------------------------------
All items that appear in the Web menu are stored in the URLS.TXT file.
You can add to or modify the contents of the file with any text editor,
following these rules:

Each line represents a menu item.  (UNIX folks, this is a DOS CR/LF
terminated line.)

A line containing a "-" is an unselectable menu divider.

The menu item name is followed by a comma (,) and then the URL, for example:

     Get the latest Private Idaho,http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm

Don't use multiple commas in a menu item name, as Private Idaho parses the
URL after the first comma.

To save Private Idaho settings:
-------------------------------
The Save Settings command in the File menu writes all of your current
settings (such as remailer type, whether to minimize PGP, encrypt to
self, latent time setting, etc.) to the PIDAHO.INI file.  These settings
will be "remembered" the next time you run Private Idaho, with the various
options activated.

Adding your own e-mail software specifications:
-----------------------------------------------
The EMAIL.TXT file contains specifications for a variety of e-mail
packages.  Up to 12 e-mail apps will be displayed in the dialog box
when you choose Options from the Transfer menu.

The file is a text file, with each line representing e-mail
information.  The file format is simple.  A record consists of:

line 1 - the name of the app to appear on the button (i.e. MS Mail)
line 2 - the program name as it appears when you ALT+TAB (Microsoft Mail)
line 3 - the first header in a new message (i.e. To:)
line 4 - the second header in a new message (i.e. CC:)
line 5 - the third header in a new message (i.e. Subject:)
line 6 - the fourth header in a new message (if nothing, leave blank)
line 7 - the fifth header in a new message (if nothing, leave blank)
Line 8 - the sixth header in a new message (if nothing, leave blank)

Private Idaho reads 8 lines in at a time and associates it with a
button.  When you press the button, the information is added to the
header section.

To send feedback:
-----------------
Choose the "Send feedback" command from the Help menu.  Text in the
message box will be erased, and a new message will be addressed to
me, ready for your comments.

Other stuff
-------------
Practical limitation of text in the message box, approximately 32K.

Total anonymous mailers to list for chaining, 30.

The name Private Idaho comes from a catchy B-52s song.  No deep social
meaning, just had a nice ring to it.

Thanks to John Deters for the NT fix, John Coffman for help with AOL
settings and distribution and a mirror site, M.D. Hobbs, Ned Brickley,
and Paul Leyland for a mirror sites, Robert Fries for "help-fying" this
text, and everyone that's taken the time to send me comments.
