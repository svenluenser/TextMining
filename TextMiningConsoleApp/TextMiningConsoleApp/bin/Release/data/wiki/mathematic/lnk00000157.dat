Mirror Universe 2.1 - For Win95/98
----------------------------------
Made by St0rmer


8.30.98


Mirror Universe finds the NetBIOS information, given a specific IP address. This information is what is c
ommonly called "Workgroup" and "User" names. Often such names can be "useful" on IRC or whatever. For exa
mple, if you find that someone's name is Bob with Mirror Universe, and you message them and say, "Hi Bob"
... well, you get the idea.

I take no responsibility for this program. You're being warned... you run this program at your own risk.

Any questions/problems/whatever, e-mail st0rmer@hotmail.com.

Future version release dates are subject to whenever I have to time to work on this.


Future version expectations
---------------------------

DDE support for mIRC
Exporting data to text files
Extra options
3DFX support (just kidding)
Any other cool stuff I can think of
