WHAT MINCRACK DOES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MinCrack will recover lost email passwords that are used by the University
of Minnesota's MINUET program.  Forgetting one's email password, especially
when it's saved on disk, seems to be a common problem for many people, so I
decided to help out by writing this password recovery utility.



HOW TO RUN MINCRACK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to recover a lost or forgotten MINUET email password, simply type
the following on the DOS command line:

   MINCRACK <config_file>

Replace the <config_file> parameter with the name of the MINUET configuration
file.  This file is usually called 'MINUET.CNF' and resides in you \MINUET
directory or somewhere similiar.

MINCRACK will read the MINUET configuration file and print the email username,
address, and password that are used when fetching email.



*** Notes ***

(a) MINCRACK does not verify that the MINUET configuration file you give it
    is a valid one, so it will most likely spew out garbage if you don't
    use the correct file.

(b) MINCRACK has only been tested with version 1.0b16 of MINUET, so if
    you find a version that it doesn't work with, let me know.
