Before the [A;B;Cm you need an escape prefix. You can type it in each time
you need it. I only know how to make the escape prefix using vi. It is 4
characters. They are ^v ^_ ^v ^[ (the ^ means the control key). To save
typing you can put this prefix in a file and paste it when needed. Using
Pico this is done using "^r". Here's an example of a flashing white
"hello" on a red background: ^v^_^v^[[5;37;41mhello^v^_^v^[[0m. On the
right side of the sequence the "[0m" resets the colors so the rest of the
screen doesn't blink white on red. All ansi sequences ( like [1;37;41m or
[0m ) need to be preceded by the escape prefix. When posting an article
and you are prompted for a subject you can type just anything. When you are
then in edit mode you go to the subject line and erase whatever you just
typed in and replace it with your ansi text. The escape prefix must be typed
in using vi. You can create it using vi and put in a file and then paste it
using whatever editor you want.
