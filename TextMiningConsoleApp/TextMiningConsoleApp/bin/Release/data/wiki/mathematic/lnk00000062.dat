eye

EYE magazine, based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is a free newspaper
issued once a week.  The scope of articles is greater than just
Toronto, so the hierarchy is available on a worldwide basis.  For more
information, contact eye@interlog.com (Ken Campbell).  NNTP feeds can
be arranged through him if you cannot get the groups from your regular
feeds.

gnu
---

gnUSENET (gnUSENET is Not USENET) is a set of newsgroups that are
gated bi-directionally with the Internet mailing lists of the GNU
Project of the Free Software Foundation.  GNU (GNU's Not Unix) will be
a complete operating system, including application programs, with
freely redistributable source code.  Please use ONLY gnu.misc.discuss
for discussion of topics considered contrary to GNU aims and political
philosophy (e.g., porting of GNU code to Apple machines, usefulness of
intellectual property laws, etc.).

The GNU mailing lists and newsgroups, like the GNU project itself,
exist to promote the freedom to share software.  So please don't use
these newsgroups (or the other GNU lists) to promote or recommend
non-free software.  (Using them to post ordering information is the
ultimate faux pas.)  If there is no free program to do a certain task,
then somebody should write one!

If one of your USENET feeds cannot provide you with a feed of the
gnUSENET newsgroups, send mail to gnu.gnusenet.config@prep.ai.mit.edu
to ask for a feed.

Questions about GNU can be directed to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu or:
        Free Software Foundation
        675 Massachusetts Avenue
        Cambridge, MA  02139
        USA
        +1-617-876-3296

Special notes about some of the groups:

Use gnu.emacs.help to discuss software on gnu.emacs.sources and to ask
for sources.  gnu.emacs.sources is archived by many sites and they
want sources ONLY!

The gnu.*.bug groups are pseudo-moderated (that is, the group is
marked moderated so that postings are mailed to prep.ai.mit.edu and
then redistributed to the both the mailing list and newsgroup from
there).  The gnu.*announce groups are all fully moderated.

The IEEE newsgroups concern the IEEE -- the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers.  The IEEE is willing to distribute these
newsgroups via NNTP to any site that desires to carry them; contact
usenet@ieee.org for details.

inet/ddn
--------

Another alternative hierarchy is the "inet/ddn" distribution.  This
consists of many newsgroups bearing names similar to traditional
Usenet groups and corresponding to Internet discussion lists.  These
groups are circulated using the NNTP transport mechanism amongst sites
on the Internet in an attempt to reduce the number of copies of these
groups flowing through the mail (some sites get these groups via UUCP
and other transport mechanisms, but the volume can be substantial and
load may be significant without a high-speed link).

The ddn groups, ddn.mgt-bulletin and ddn.newsletter, are no longer
valid.  According to nic@nic.ddn.mil (Page Carter), the US Department
of Defense removed all non-*.mil addresses from the associated mailing
lists for these groups.  A *.mil gateway will not be established
because that again exposes the traffic to non-*.mil sites via news
propagation.

Erik Fair <fair@apple.com> led the creation of inet groups.

info
----

The "info" hierarchy is a collection of mailing lists gatewayed into
news at the University of Illinois.  The lists are selected based on
local interests but have proven popular at a number of sites.  Groups
are removed when they become available via more mainstream
hierarchies.  Sites are encouraged to mark *'ed groups as 'n' in their
active file.  These groups are generally concerned with getting real
work done and readers dislike extraneous postings.  Postings can still
be made by emailing to the listed contact address.

k12
---

K12Net is a collection of conferences devoted to K-12 educational
curriculum, language exchanges with native speakers, and
classroom-to-classroom projects designed by teachers.  The
conferences are privately distributed among FidoNet-compatible
electronic bulletin board systems in Africa, Asia, Australia,
Europe, and North America, as well as available from uunet.uu.net
as Usenet newsgroups in the hierarchy k12.*

Classroom-to-classroom projects are featured in the K12 "Channels"
which are periodically reassigned based on usage and appropriate
project length.  They comprise the k12.sys hierarchy.

Forums for casual conversation among students are divided by grade
level in the k12.chat hierarchy; there is also an area for teachers to
exchange general ideas about using telecommunications in education.

For more information, contact one of the members of
the K12Net Council of Coordinators:

Terry Bowden      <bowden@vnet.ibm.com>
Robert Brault     <braultr@csmanoirs.qc.ca>
Wolfgang Hofmeier <whofmeie@cln.etc.bc.ca>
George Perkins    <ggperk01@homer.louisville.edu>
Geoff Shearsby    <g.shearsby@edfac.usyd.edu.au>
Les Turner        <lturner@uranus.esc.k12.in.us>
Louis Van Geel    <elvege@cybcobe.cybco.be>

Mr. Brault is currently the chairman of the council, so he is probably
the best one to contact first.
