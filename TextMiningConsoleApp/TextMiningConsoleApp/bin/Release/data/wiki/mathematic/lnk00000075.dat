                                      How to crack Blood 2 cd protection
                                                 A little update to my tutorial#1
                                                            written by ByteBurn

Intro:
Hello Dudes!Welcome to the little update for my Tutorial#1 (Introducing into the world of cracking).I hop
e you enjoyed my Tutorial and i hope you`ll enjoy this little plus tutorial :).
I am at home and i brought Blood2 (English version) of a video shop.Now 5mins ago i cracked it and i thin
k i`ve to tell you how you can do that.I like to help newbies on their way up to a real cracker.And excus
e my english i know it isnt the best :).

What we need to crack:
At first you need WDasm8.9 and Hiew5.9.WDasm is a disassembler and Hiew is a little good HexEditor.Rememb
er that this tutorial is only a little tutorial i write for you that you can crack some more and dont hav
e to wait for my next real tutorial (what can take some time :))So i dont explain exatly step by step wha
t to do here.If you have read my Tutorial#1 you know what to do and it`ll be easy for you to follow my in
structions.I hope it will :).

Lets start:
Ok at first make a full install of the game (i make a full install cause i like the movies too.I dont kno
w if there is any error message if you delete movies or sound like "Cannot find intro.avi" or anything el
se).Then start the game without cd to get the error message.The message says "Please insert the Blood2 cd
 into your Cd-Rom"or something like that.Now
make two copys of the Blood2.exe.One called Blood2.exx (the save copy if you nop or manipulate something
wrong and the game wont work) and one called Blood2.w32 (this one you`ll use for Wdasm to disassemble).I
dont will explain why to do that here cause i write it in my Tutorial#1 (if you dont have it maybe you`ll
 download it to understand better about what i am talking here.You can download it on www.crackstore.com.
).Start Wdasm and disassemble the Blood2.w32 file.After the disassembling process click on the String Dat
a References button on the upper right site of the screen.Now a little window pops up with lots of error
messages and other messages of the game.Look out for the error message you recieved when you start the ga
me without cd (Please insert Blood2 cd into your cd-rom).
You can see it on the first page of the window you dont have to scroll down.Doubleclick on the message.No
w you`ll be warped to the string where the error message is stored.This will looks like this:

:00403FB6 6A08               push 00000008
:00403FB8 51                  push ecx
:00403FB9 FFD3               call ebx
:00403FBB 85C0              test eax, eax
:00403FBD 7524              jne 00403FE3     <----------ah any jne.Maybe thats the badboy?

:00403FED 6A3E                          push 0000003E

this screen you`ve to see on your monitor if you doubleclick on the error message (ohh do you know how mu
ch i like to write asm-codes like this into tutorials like this?Hehe...).
Know all you `ve to do is to click on the "Goto Cd Location" Button on the upper middle of the screen and
 enter the number of the *Referenced by (U)nconditional or (C)onditional Jump at Address: 00403FBD(C) num
ber and click on ok.You`ll be warped to any string in the
asm-code.Its a jne command.This one calls the window error box on your screen if there is no cd present i
n drive.Ok take a look down at the @Offset number.Its 000033BD.Remember the number (witthout all the 0000
) and go to Hiew.Load your Blood2.exe in Hiew.Click on F4 and select decode mode.Then click on F5 and ent
er the @Offset number,its 33BD.You`ll be warped to the jne command.Click on F3 and change the value of jn
e to je.This will happen when you change 75 to 74.Now you can save it and leave Hiew.Start your game and
taaddaaa it works.Ok you make it.I hope you see how easy it is to get the error message and kill it.This
was a very very veryyy easy protection sheme and you`ve to learn more about cracking if you want be good.

OH SHIT!!!!:
Dudes....i now see what i do wrong!The game have more then one "badboy"you can see it if you click often
on the error message in Data String References window.That means that if you disable only the one jne lik
e i discribe up it wont have the effect you`ll recieve.It can be that if you start the game sometimes it`
ll always show you the error message.Now you can do two things.One:You play it with the "Bug Crack" that
means that sometimes when you start the game it wont work and you have to start it often to get into the
game.Or step two:
You crack every jne you can see when you click often on the error message in String Data Window.If you wa
nt to crack it real you`ve to do everything like i discribe up but you`ve to do it more then one times.Yo
u have to do it on every place of the string you`ll be warped when you doubleclick on the errror message
in SDR window.Ok ok i know i am shit and i do a mistake but know you can see that it isnt so easy to crac
k no much harder but take more time.You can crack it without my help if you do what i discribe up.Hmm and
 i wondered why it sometimes work and sometimes not HAHA.Thats one of the things you`ve remember too!
Everytime doubleclick more then one time on the errror message in SDR (String Data References) window!Do
that and you wont have this kind of trouble with your game :)))

NO PANIC!!!:
Hehe no panic dudes!I found the error...the only thing you`ve to do is to change another jne on the same
window.The @Offset number is 3389.If you change this one from jne in je you can play the game.I do it and
 i have no problems for now.Only look up a bit in the asm and you`ll find after one or two calls the jne.
In hiew its this kind of jne`s i explain in Tutorial#1.
Its one of the 0F85964553 kinds.So dint worry only change the 85 behinf 0F to 84 and all will work.You do
nt have to nop it or anything else.Its only a little bit longer thats all :))).Ok enjoy it!And have fun.I
 hope you`re now happy and not longer angry of me for taking you in shock situation :)))Hehe...
Hmm..how i think...it is enough when you change 3389...you dont have to change the one i describe up...
I think so..try it..if not change it the game works...

cause it take so long to load my mails when they are full of any questions.If you havent got IRC mail me.
Maybe it`ll take some time but i`ll answer.I like to help newbies cause they are the future of cracking e
lite and if nobody help them the art of cracking will die...and thats isnt what we want or?hehe.So i`ll b
