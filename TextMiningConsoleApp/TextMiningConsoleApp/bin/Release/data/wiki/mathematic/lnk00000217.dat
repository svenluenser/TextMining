This FAQ is intended to help players of Wasteland, the best game ever
made for the Apple //.  If you feel you have some knowledge to add to this
database feel free to update it and upload it to Asimov, on four conditions:

        1) You must rename the file to fit the current date, so as not to
        overwrite the previous version, and change the Date above.

                wasteland_faq_MM-DD-YYYY.txt

                Ex: wasteland_faq_01-16-1996.txt

                If you do not have long filenames use

                wfaqMMDD.txt

                Ex: wfaq0116.txt

                Hopefully someone else will give it a long name in a future
                version.

        2) You must update the Table of Contents.

        3) The update must be in ASCII text format.

        4) Most important -- you absolutely MUST update the newest
        version.
                You'd do a great disservice to other gamers to update an old
                version and lose all the information included in newer
                versions.  So if you plan on making an addition download the
                newest version immediately before updating it.

0. Generally Important Stuff

        Wasteland modifies ALL of the disks.  You need to keep backup copies of
the original.  Whenever you exit an area, Wasteland saves EVERYTHING you
modified since you entered.
        *Some emulators (such as STM for the Mac) force you to manually save the
changes to disks, so when leaving an area which you have cleared or finished,
be certain to save the changes, else you might have to do it all over again.

1. Attributes

        1.1 Attribute Descriptions

                Strength (ST) - Helps determine damage done to enemies in
                        melee combat.  Also lets you break down doors and
                        force objects.

                Intelligence (IQ) - Without doubt the most important skill in
                        the game.  It gives you skill points to learn new
                        skills and gives you a wider selection of skills to
                        select.

                Luck (LK) - Influences every part of the game where a random
                        number is involved.  Combat, traps, using skills, etc...

                Speed (SP) - Determines the order you act in combat.  The
                        sooner you act the less time enemies have to react.
                        Becomes sort of useless when guns are involved --
                        everyone shoots at the same time.  It does help you
                        run during combat.

                Agility (AGL) - How quick you move (could have combined speed with
                        this, but they didn't).  Influences likelihood of hitting in
                        melee.  Also determines whether you'll be injured or not in
                        all situations.

                Dexterity (DEX) - How steady your aim with ranged weapons is.

                Charisma (CHR) - How personable you are.  Pretty useless.  It
                        influences how NPCs react when you attempt to hire,
                        but not too much.  Just have everyone hire and you'll
                        succeed.  The only symptoms of low charisma are NPCs
                        who don't want to trade items all the time.  Just keep
                        trying until you succeed.  Attribute points are too
                        important to waste here.

                Skill Points (SKP) - Determines how many skills you can learn.
                        when you Radio to go up levels increasing IQ gives you
                        the same number of Skill Points.  Use skill points in
                        libraries.  Caution:  no 2 libraries carry all the
                        same skills.  If you want a skill and have enough IQ
                        you still won't be offered it if the Library doesn't
                        carry the books.  The library in North-West Needles
                        carries basic skills.  The library in SE Las Vegas
                        carries skills for higher IQs (18-23).  The library in
                        Darwin city, Citadel, and Sleeper Base carry special
                        advanced skills.

                Rank - Just a fancy indicator of experience level.  General is
                        over level 100.

                MAXCON / CON - Your hit maximum and current hit points.  You
                        heal over time.  Time passes fastest on the main land
                        map.  Unconscious and worse off characters usually
                        cannot be hit during combat.  Traps can still mess
                        them up.

                        If your CON is still a number but highlighted in white,
                        then your character is diseased and will not heal.
                        In the sewers the whole party is diseased.  If they
                        all go unconscious, your party is dead.  Only hospitals
                        can heal diseases.  (Actually, I haven't tried using
                        antitoxin on disease, any one try it?)

                        UNC - Unconscious.  Give him time and he'll recover.
                        SER - Serious.  He needs a medic, if not he'll
                                deteriorate.
                        CRT - Critical.  This is about the limit Medic will
                                work on.
                        MRT - Mortally wounded.  He needs someone with Doctor.
                        COM - Comatose.  This character will die soon.
                                Doctor 1 can heal COMATOSE with a some effort.
                                If you have no doctor make sure you find a
                                nice grave site.
                        skull symbol - Dead.  This ain't Bard's Tale.  There's
                                no magic, no resurrect.  Dead is dead.
                                Disband the character.

                AC(Armor Class) - Indicator of how much damage the character's
                        armor will absorb when hit.  Ranges from 0 - 15.  A 1 is
                        infinitely better than a 0.

        1.2 Attribute Hints

                At the start of the game spend almost all points on raising IQ
                        Until you hit about 28.  Then if you've got the skill-points
                        cheat going, spend 1 on constitution each level and one on
                        something else.  Important attributes are: Luck, Dexterity,
                        and Agility.  Strength is moderately useful, but don't
                        concentrate on it.  Charisma is useless.

                After Luck, Dexterity, and Agility get in the 20s you'd be
                        best off putting your points into Constitution.  If you need
                        to obtain 128 SKP to get an ornery skill up to Negative SKP
                        level go hard after IQ.

                I will not accept a character with less that 17 IQ unless
                        they've got extraordinary Luck, Dexterity, and Agility.

                Constitution is moderately important at the start.  There's
                        not really much difference between a 25 and a 35.  If
                        something's going to kill a character with 25 CON, chances
                        are it'd do likewise to someone with 35 CON.  Only worry
                        about Constitution if it's real low.

                A good IQ will more than make up for a low MaxCon.

                Plus you can always raise MaxCon by going up levels -- harder to
                        do without good skills or ability to inflict damage.

2. Equipment

        Right now I've only covered the basic weapons.  There's more, but
        frankly I don't remember them all.  Plus there are several items
        you can get.  Hand mirrors are useless, matches let you detonate
        explosives, rope lets you crawl down holes and across pits, canteens
        let you traverse the desert without heat exhaustion.

        There are more items, but their use would better fit under part 5.
        Solutions to Puzzles.

        2.1 Good Stuff

                Leather Jackets - at the start put them on people who are hurt.
                        Some armor is infinitely better than none at all.  *AC1

                Ax - Until you find how to reach Darwin City safely these are
                        the weapon of choice for those without pugilism.

                chainsaws - they rule in combination with brawling, don't be
                        surprised to have a low-level character inflict 100
                        damage per round with this lethal combination plus
                        they never run out of ammo.  A temporary fix for
                        characters without pugilism.  Once you get pugilism
                        level 3 forget all other melee weapons and concentrate
                        on raising brawling and pugilism. By the time I solved
                        it my characters were doing about 40,000 damage per
                        round!!!  Only 1 creature in the game has more than
                        1000 Hit points, for comparison.  Can only buy a
                        Chainsaw in Darwin city. *There is also a chainsaw in the
                        sewers under Las Vegas, guarded, if memory serves, by
                        Clawmen and a Clawman Leader.

                *Proton Axe - an incredibly powerful melee weapon, doing 45-70
                        damage per hit for a character with moderate strength and
                        brawling.  Can be found in the building on Sahara Road in
                        Las Vegas with an insect swarm and the letters A. P. spelled
                        out in blocks.

                Plastic Explosives - in combination with high-level demolition
                        this will destroy everything up to 40 feet away

                Uzi - Best general purpose weapon in the game until you fight
                        the major enemies.  A 9MM clip (cheap) gives you 40
                        shots each which does 10-30 damage.  Doesn't make
                        sense that the same bullets do more damage from an
                        Uzi than from a pistol, but who's complaining?  Can
                        only buy it in Darwin City.
                        Takes 9mm ammo.

                M1989A1 - A powerful conventional weapon.  After you get the
                        big guns it's handy to keep Assault Rifles and SMGs
                        on-hand for little fights.  Conserve those power packs.
                        Takes 7.62mm ammo.

                AK-97 - At one point I really wanted these instead of M1989A1s
                        but I'm not sure why.  I think they do more damage
                        per shot and are better at armor piercing.  But it's
                        been years so I could be wrong.
                        Takes 7.62mm ammo.

                Kevlar Suit - you'll find a few of these, but these are the
                        3rd best armor in the game. *AC6

                Rad Suit - When you first get them, they seem pretty cool but
                        that's not what Rad stands for.  It means radiation.
                        Once you get better armor, still lug around Rad suits
                        on everyone -- you'll need them.  *AC5.

                *Kevlar Vest - A good step up from Bulletproof Shirts.  AC4.

                *Bulletproof Shirt - Despite the name, this stops more than just
                        bullets, but just barely.  AC2.

                *Robe - Same AC as the Leather Jacket, but has some deception
                        value in penetrating the Temple of Blood in Needles.  AC1.

                Geiger Counter - Tells what level radiation is.  You can only
                        see radiation outdoors at night so Geiger counters
                        are useful when it's invisible.  You only need one
                        per party.  Ever wonder what those 5 squares on the
                        left side of the screen are?  That's the Geiger
                        counter reading.  When it hits 4, you're standing
                        right next to radiation.  Either put rad suits on
                        everyone or go back the way you came.

                TNT - use this for low-end demolitions.  Plastique is too
                        expensive to be wasted on demolitions.  Same goes for
                        rockets.  Save your rockets for the Citadel.

                Canteen - NPCs don't usually come with them, so they'll get
                        hurt in the heat.  You only need 1 per character.

                Rockets - These pack a big punch and are armor piercing.  RPG
                        are best.  Law Rockets are good.  Sabot rockets are
                        the least powerful of the group, but they pierce armor
                        well.  Save rockets for the Citadel.  Don't kill
                        Scorpitron with them.   After you take out the Citadel
                        you'll toast Scorpitron in a couple rounds.  You might
                        need to use rockets to blow through walls in the sewer
                        and a door in the bottom of Base Cochise.  *Manglers also
                        fit into this category and are a somewhat effective solution
                        to killing the Scorpitron in Las Vegas, as they are weak yet
                        still pierce armor.

                Meson Cannon - The most powerful weapon in the game, only 10
                        ammo per clip.  Use single shots, not burst, once
                        you've got good Energy Weapons skill.

                Ion Beamer - Second only to the meson cannon.  20 ammo per
                        clip so it's more economical on medium enemies.

                Laser Rifle - If you don't cheat there's only 2 meson cannons
                        and 1 Ion Beamer.  These are useful by default.

                Power Packs - Once you get Energy Weapons these are your ammo.
                        The only problem is that you can never buy more of
                        them.  You only get what you find, so use them with
                        care.  If you don't need Energy Weapons to win a
                        battle, don't use them.

                Grenades - Hurl away when you find them.  They're not much
                        use later in the game but are useful near the start.

        NOTE: equip explosives to use them in combat, don't try U)se I)tem
                that's how you blow up doors and walls not enemies.  unE)quip
                might be misleading.  Just hit 'E' to change what your weapon
                in combat.  If you select the weapon you're already using
                you'll equip FISTS.

        2.2 Worthless Stuff

                M19 Rifle - When you're at the point where you can afford
                        these you'll be very close to getting your first truly
                        powerful long range weapons --SMGs and Assault Rifles
                        Takes 7.62mm ammo.

                M17 Carbine - Similar to the M19, but less powerful.  Another
                        fine waste of money.
                        Takes 7.62mm ammo.

                Flamethrower - a nice novelty, but fairly useless.  Costs a
                        bunch   and you CANNOT reload it.  Uzis are much
                        cheaper and more powerful.

                Pistols - why waste your money?  You'll find hundreds of these.
                        Generally a waste of ammo.

                Knives - throwing are useless compared even with pistols.  Get
                        an ax for melee.  Note: you will need ONE knife in
                        your party far into the game when you're bound in rope.

                MAC-15 - Uzis are better.  If you've got 45 caliber ammo to
                        burn chances are you'll have found one already.  Feel
                        free to go full-auto with these when you find them.
                        You don't need 45 caliber ammo anymore.
                        Takes .45 caliber ammo.

                Laser Pistol - About as powerful as an Uzi, but they use
                        precious power packs.  Use an Uzi instead and sell the
                        laser pistols.  Of course feel free to burn all the
                        ammo in the gun first, just don't reload.  These
                        cannot hurt enemies in the Citadel. You might want to
                        keep one on hand, see Skill Hints for more on this.

                Laser Carbine - Just a shade more powerful than the Laser
                        Pistol.  Same rules apply.

        2.3 Equipment Hints

                If your weapon is empty you'll use it as a melee weapon.  If
                you don't have pugilism but you do have a high energy weapons,
                keep an empty Energy Weapon (likely a laser pistol) on hand.
                When you strike with it it'll use your energy weapons skill in
                determining damage -- not pugilism.  Granted it won't do as
                much damage as fists and level 6 pugilism, but it'll still do
                about 40-70 damage per blow with a decent skill level.
                Brawling still works no matter what melee weapon you're using.

3. Skills

        The Heart of Wasteland.  This is what separates it from other RPGs.

        3.1 Descriptions of useful skills

                Numbers in brackets are base Skill Points Required. IQ is
                required. At this point I'm only sure of the basic ones offered at
                the start, but there's many more.  Feel free to add others.

                IQ 3

                Brawling (1) - Gives an extra melee attack for 2 levels.

                Climb (1) - Self-explanatory.  Try climbing on things like
                        tables and fences in addition to the obvious.  Only
                        one per party needs it.  Many NPCs have it so don't
                        bother with it on your characters.  Raise it by
                        climbing the sand hills in Southern Needles.

                Pugilism (1) - Increases damage done with FISTS.

                Swim (1) - Obvious.  Everyone needs it including NPCs.

                *Clip Pistol (1) - While this may seem a self-evident skill to get
                        for a new party, experience points are halved for kills
                        obtained via ranged weapons like pistols, rifles, and the
                        like.  A party will rise through the ranks much faster if
                        they skip using pistols altogether, with the added benefit
                        of not being thrown into combat against melee-only opponents
                        (provided the party has no ranged weapons equipped) until
                        the party is right next to them.

                IQ 6

                Perception (1) - Lets you see things that are hidden.  Only
                        2 people per party need it.  1 if he's really good.
                        A level 4 or 5 perception should cover the game.

                Assault Rifle (1) - Lets you hit with them.

                AT Weapon (1) - At least 2 people in the party should have
                        level 2 AT Weapon to raid the Citadel.  Covenant
                        is pretty good with them, so just give it to
                        one of yours.  Extras could help, but I think the
                        SKP are better used elsewhere. You cannot afford to miss.  2
                        Level 4 AT weapons will do you more good than 7 level 2s.

                SMG (1) - Lets you hit with them.

                IQ 10

                Acrobat (1) - Only need 1 per party.  I don't know if any
                        NPCs have it.  Just get level 1.  *This skill can be
                        increased in the same way as Climb on the hills in Needles.

                Picklock (1) - Of utmost importance.  You'll need it a lot.
                        Only 1 per party.  Get level 2.

                Silent Movement (1) - Not quite sure how useful it is.  Never
                        was able to get a high level in it.  Maybe if you
                        did you could walk right through the Citadel.  Never
                        tried it.

                IQ 13

                Demolition (1) - Fire, Fire, Fire!!! Huh, huh, huh.
                        Without it you'll blow yourself up with TNT etc...

                IQ 14

                Alarm Disarm (1) - Only one place to use it -- the Needles
                        police station.  Don't REALLY need it, but it can
                        help.  *In fact, the alarm system in the Needles police
                        station can be turned off in the communications center
                        there.

                IQ 15

                Bomb Disarm (2) - Bomb traps are the deadliest things you'll
                        encounter in the game.  One per party, get a decent
                        level or you'll be sorry.  Save before using it.

                Medic (2) - Very important, but hesitate to give it to all
                        characters.  Once you get an IQ in the low 20s go
                        to Las Vegas's library and give everyone Doctor 1.
                        Doctor 1 can heal Comatose people, Medic 40 cannot.
                        Level 1 Medic is completely useless.  Start with
                        2 level 2 Medics.

                Safecrack (2) - Like picklock for big doors.

                IQ 16

                Cryptology (2) - Lets you decode messages / passwords.  Get
                        a high level on 1 or 2 characters.

        3.2 Skill Hints

                Make sure everyone in your party has Level 1 Energy Weapons
                before entering the Citadel.  They'll all be level 5-7 by
                the time you leave.  Get a few Doctors too.

                A good way to raise brawling is to equip yourself with a
                non-weapon, such as a broken toaster or plasma couple,
                and fight something tough.  Cornered denizens of the
                Citadel work great after you get the Power Armor.  You
                just keep wailing on them without inflicting any damage
                and your brawling skill keeps going up.  You can try it
                with fists equipped, but after pugilism hits level 3
                you'll eventually kill whatever you're fighting.  But
                that's the ONLY way to increase pugilism without mondo
                skill points.  The woman guarding the door to the ion beamer
                seems to work OK after you've got some armor.


                The tougher the thing you're fighting, the quicker it'll
                bring up your skill level.  That's one use of a laser pistol
                -- you'll never kill it, but you will raise your Energy
                Weapons level.  If you disk-swap and load up on power packs
                you can blast away at tough enemies until you've got a level
                6 or 7 Energy Weapons.  Then you're home free.


                You NEED level 3 or higher swimming in the sewers on EVERYONE
                who enters the water.  If people don't have it split your
                party, but you'll be sorry.  There's some tough fights down
                there and everyone gets diseased.  When someone goes
                unconscious, they stay that way until you visit a hospital.
                Jump in the river by the bridge for low-level characters.
                They'll go unconscious but they shouldn't die.

                *I (Chris Baer) would offer a different take on the sewers.  The
                first time you get into the sewers, be certain that all characters
                have at least Swim 1 and are fully healed.  Then just jump in and
                fight the current whenever you can.  I started Covenant with Swim
                1, and by the time the current dumped the party into the river
                outside Las Vegas, he had Swim 5.  My other characters experienced
                a similar rise in levels without having to shell out major skill
                points for Swim 2 or more.  Of course, if all the characters go
                unconscious when diseased with Sewer Rot, game over, so beware.

                I usually don't take characters with less than 16 IQ.  Of
                course 18 is best, but if someone has great luck and
                dexterity I'll take them with a 15 IQ.

4. General Hints

        4.1 General Hints

                It's generally a good idea to back up your party in case they get
                saved in a place where they're stuck.

                Lots of traps are under treasure bags.  If you remove all of the
                treasure the trap is exposed and you're screwed.  Case in point:
                the Citadel Armory.  The traps are usually in places you'd expect
                traps, so just leave something relatively useless there to avoid
                the trap.

                You can rack up experience early on by just sitting in the Nomad's
                complex and fighting all the Nuke Pooches / Lizards that come
                along. Later on, base cochise works well if you use the disk
                swapping method and kill things walking around OUTSIDE of the
                complex. Stuff inside starts to hurt and you can't escape and heal
                if your party's in trouble.

                *When exploring the sewers, you are likely to have to get "washed
                out" a few times in order to raise CON points, which do not heal
                because of the Sewer Rot.  Rather than curing it each time you go
                to a hospital (which is the only way to raise CON points while
                diseased), simply pay for healing (preferably in Highpool, which
                has the best rates) and remain diseased.  Then head straight back
                to the sewers, where you would just get diseased again anyway.
                Also, while in the sewers, be sure to have lots of TNT available
                to blast through "hollow sounding" walls.

5. Solutions to Puzzles and Q & A

        Q: How do I get in the building in SE downtown Needles?  They ask for
                a password, but I've never found the answer.  I can't blow the
                door down.

        *A: Acapulco.  One of the bums in Needles mumbles this if you give him
                two Snake Squeezins.

        Q: What Are fruit good for?

        A: Obviously you can sell them.

                But later on in the game you need to make an antitoxin with
                the fruit, but I think you only need to keep 2.  That's OK,
                just sell the fruit and buy however many you need back when
                you need them. *The general store in Darwin sells them.

                With the Anti-Toxin you can get Metal Maniac and Mad Dog
                Fargo, two of the better NPCs in the game.

        *Q: Where can I get chemicals?

        *A: There is one chemical in Housekeeping in the Stagecoach Inn and
                there are three chemicals on a table in Ugly's hideout.

        Q: There's lots of walls that look weak.  What do I do to them?

        A: Blow 'em up with TNT.  Works on doors too.  Some walls/doors are
                stronger than others and require Plastic Explosives / Rocket
                launchers.  A prime example of walls to blow up early in the
                game are a bunch of weak walls on the NE side of downtown
                Needles.  Go through them and you'll find a gang meeting.
                They're armed with SMGs and Assault Rifles so it's not a
                fight for fresh characters.  But if you've got some armor
                and feel ready for a challenge take them out -- the rewards
                are too high to pass up.

                NOTE: Try picklock and safecrack on doors before you blast 'em.

        Q: My character died, how to I bring him back to life?

        A: As I said before, this isn't a Fantasy RPG.  There's no magic.
                Bury the character and make a new one.  If you've found
                Sleeper Base, you can clone characters to use after they die.
                You need clone skill and jugs.

        Q: Which NPCs should I keep?

        A: It depends what stage in the game you're on.

                Most of the early NPCs waste your ammo and don't do anything
                useful.  Use them as bullet catchers if you want.  They won't
                mind :)  *NPC's in this class include Jackie (in Highpool), Mayor
                Pedros (in Quartz), Ralf (in Needles), and Felicia (in Quartz)

                Drop 'em when they're dead or badly hurt if you don't have
                Medics/Doctors.

                Keepers:

                Christina - She's the first decent NPC you'll find.  Plus
                        she's got an Uzi.  Find her in downtown Needles in
                        the alley West of the ammo store.  Hit 'E' to start
                        an encounter then hire her.  Drop her when you run
                        out of space for a better NPC.

                Covenant - Great with AT Weapons and a decent Medic.  He's in
                        North-East Las Vegas in jail.  He's unguarded, but
                        don't set off the traps.  You'll need picklock to free
                        him.

                Metal Maniac - He's pretty good, that's all I remember.  I
                        think he's better than Mad Dog Fargo, but the choice
                        is up to you.

                Redwind - He rocks.  He's in the jail in the Citadel.  You can
                        return him to Savage Village to solve a mini-quest.
                        Then go back to the Citadel and get him again, he's too
                        good to throw away.

                Ace - I've heard he's good, but never found him myself.
                        *Ace is in Ugly's hideout in Quartz, underneath the bar in
                        the officer's club.  He has the knowhow to fix the jeep,
                        which he drives straight to the garage in Needles and then,
                        once you've recovered the Bloodstaff and received, in
                        return, a cache of arms which includes an engine, straight
                        to Las Vegas where you lose it to bandits.

        Q: How do I raise the portcullis to go up the stairs in the Citadel?

        A: Use strength on the chain in the little room next to it.  You'll
                need a pretty big character to do this.  It's possible with
                strength 18, but it'll take many many attempts.

        *Q: How do I fix the jeep.

        *A: You can't.  Only Ace can fix the jeep.

        *Q: What do I do with the Servo Motor? the Fusion Cell? the ROM Board?
                the Android Head? the Power Converter?

        *A: Save every one of the above that you can find.  They are necessary
                for putting Max together and for fixing parts of Sleeper Base.

        *Q: What is the correct path for the chessboard in the Temple of Blood?

        *A: The correct path, which is 30 squares, is as follows:

                F L L L L F F R R R R R B R R F F F F L L B L L L L F F R R

                Where F=forwards, B=backwards, R=right, and L=left.


6. Cheating

        You really thought there was such a thing as a CRPG you can't cheat
        at?  Not a chance.  You just need to be a little creative for
        Wasteland because the programmers did a good job trying to stop
        people from cheating.

        This section makes the game a little too easy, so I'd recommend
        against it the first time you play.  It'd just defeat the fun of the
        wonderful game.

        However after you solve the game, go wild the next time!


        6.1 Disk Switching

                Enter an area with a copy of the original disk, then place
                another copy in the drive after the area is loaded.  Do
                what you want, take all the treasure you want, hire whoever
                you want, kill whomever you want, then leave.  The stuff will
                be saved as modified on the disk you placed in the drive BUT
                THE FIRST DISK WILL BE UNCHANGED.

                You can just place the first disk in the drive and repeat the
                process.  An easy way to rack up items, cash, allies, and
                experience.

                It saves what you buy and sell too.  The stores rarely runs
                out of things they're originally stocked with (never ammo),
                but if you sell them 2 power packs they only have 2 power
                packs in stock for you to buy again later.

                But if you are creative with the disk-switching technique you
                can work around this too.

        6.2 Negative Skill Point Cheat

                As you well know, the Apple // is an 8-bit machine.
                Apparently the programmers decided to use Signed Integers
                to represent the number of skill points it takes to go up
                skill levels.  This means that skills can never require more
                than 128 skill points to go up a level.  You'll likely never
                get than many skill points, but don't fret.

                I'll use energy weapons as my example.  Level 1 takes 3 skill
                points.  Every level doubles the previous requirement, so
                level 2 takes 6, 3 takes 12, etc...  But what if you want
                level 8 Energy Weapons?  It would take 384 skill points, but
                the Apple can't count that high on one register.  You can
                achieve Level 7 by fighting and using the skill, but not
                level 8.

                (NOTE:  it's been 6 years so my numbers could be off, but the
                general case holds true)

                To get level 8 go to a Library.  It'll say you need 255 Skill
                Points to go up another level.  It's lying.  If you try to
                increase your level the register loops around to a negative
                and you actually GET ANOTHER SKILL POINT FOR GOING UP A LEVEL.
                Your skill level can never be higher than your experience
                level so don't be frightened when the process stops.  Just go
                kill some more, radio, then try again.

                It's very hard to get pugilism and demolitions over level 6.
                You might need to cave in and spend 128 skill points to enter
                the realm of omnipotence in Wasteland.

                Also you might want to get some useless skills that are easy
                to raise in level so you can spend negative skill points in
                the library on them :)

        6.3 Infinite Money

                At the start of the game each character starts with piddly
                cash and some cheap equipment.  For a head-start make a
                bunch of characters and trade the pistols to the first guy
                and have him P)ool cash.  Then delete the losers and do it
                over again.  When the first guy's inventory is full of
                pistols save the game and create a band of some more losers
                to take with him.  You can use a similar technique on each
                one to rake in even more cash if you've got the time.  Then
                make a mad dash to Quartz.  There's a store in the
                South-West corner.

                Sell EVERYTHING.

                P)ool all cash to one character then return to the Ranger
                Center.  Don't worry if one of them dies.

                Delete all the characters except the one with the dough,
                then make your first REAL character.  Give him all the money
                and delete the old guy.  Then create the rest of your party.
                Not an immense boost but it'll give you about $10,000 each
                repetition.

                Later on you can use the disk-swapping method to bring in
                major money with RPGs and Energy Weapons.
