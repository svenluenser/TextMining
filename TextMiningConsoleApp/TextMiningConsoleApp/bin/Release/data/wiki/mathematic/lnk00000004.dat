-TBAV (ThunderByte Anti-Virus)
 By: Thunderbyte B.V. or ESaSS B.V.
 Year: 1989-1998
 Type: anti-virus toolkit
 Desc:
  utils to prevent, detect and recover from a virus
   attack: runtime scanner, TSR scanner, chksummer, TSR chksum checker,
   (disk/mem/file) protor, heur.cleaner, UI, wiper, save/restore MBR/BS/CMOS
   and self-check BS/MBR maker
 V8.09 [1998]
 Adv:
  generic TSRs (except the scanner) -> usable even today
  world 1st heur.cleaner (?)
  CyR: the best doc
  scanner explains why a file triggered alarm
  TSR scanner can use XMS or EMS
  prot against tunneling and ANSI bombs by 'TSRs driver'
  can log everything
  nice heuristics
  BS prot in MBR code which CRC-checking BS
  the same code on floppies allows user to boot from HD if no system on
   the FD
  possible to set which prog can go TSR/modify executables/write to
   disk/etc.
 Disadv:
  I've yet to see it find a Win virus
  the TSR scanner doesn't find many viruses by copying (although it finds
   them if the infected file is being executed)
  cleaner doesn't allow wildcards
  not possible to scan and repair at once (but is possible through Inter
   Engineering's TBMClean utility which runs cleaner automaticly)
  shareware
   nag screens
  development has ended
