WHAT POPCRACK DOES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PopCrack will recover lost email passwords that are used by the University
of Minnesota's POPMAIL program.  Forgetting one's email password, especially
when it's saved on disk, seems to be a common problem for many people, so I
decided to help out by writing this password recovery utility.



HOW TO RUN POPCRACK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to recover a lost or forgotten POPMAIL email password, simply type
the following on the DOS command line:

   POPCRACK <config_file>

Replace the <config_file> parameter with the name of the POPMAIL configuration
file.  This file is called 'POPMAIL.INI' and usually resides in your \WINDOWS
directory or \POPMAIL directory.

POPCRACK will read the POPMAIL configuration file and print the email username,
mail server, and password that are used when fetching email.



*** Notes ***

(a) POPCRACK has only been tested with version 1.06 of POPMAIL, so if
    you find a version that it doesn't work with, let me know.
