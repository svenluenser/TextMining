Endergonic and exergonic | Back to Top

   Energy releasing processes, ones that "generate" energy, are termed exergonic reactions.
   Reactions that require energy to initiate the reaction are known as endergonic reactions. All
   natural processes tend to proceed in such a direction that the disorder or randomness of the
   universe increases (the second law of thermodynamics).

Oxidation/Reduction | Back to Top

   Biochemical reactions in living organisms are essentially energy transfers. Often they occur
   together, "linked", in what are referred to as oxidation/reduction reactions. Reduction is the
   gain of an electron. Sometimes we also have H ions along for the ride, so reduction also becomes
   the gain of H. Oxidation is the loss of an electron (or hydrogen). In oxidation/reduction
   reactions, one chemical is oxidized, and its electrons are passed (like a hot potato) to another
   (reduced, then) chemical. Such coupled reactions are referred to as redox reactions. The
   metabolic processes glycolysis, Kreb's Cycle, and Electron Transport Phosphorylation involve the
   transfer of electrons (at varying energy states) by redox reactions.

Catabolism and Anabolism | Back to Top

   Anabolism is the total series of chemical reactions involved in synthesis of organic compounds.
   Autotrophs must be able to manufacture (synthesize) all the organic compounds they need.
   Heterotrophs can obtain some of their compounds in their diet (along with their energy). For
   example humans can synthesize 12 of the 20 amino acids, we must obtain the other 8 in our diet.
   Catabolism is the series of chemical reactions that breakdown larger molecules. Energy is
   released this way, some of it can be utilized for anabolism. Products of catabolism can be
   reassembled by anabolic processes into new anabolic molecules.

Enzymes: Organic Catalysts | Back to Top

   Enzymes allow many chemical reactions to occur within the homeostasis constraints of a living
   system. Enzymes function as organic catalysts. A catalyst is a chemical involved in, but not
   changed by, a chemical reaction. Many enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of
   reactions. By bringing the reactants closer together, chemical bonds may be weakened and
   reactions will proceed faster than without the catalyst.

                                            [catreact.gif]

   The use of enzymes can lower the activation energy of a reaction (E[a]). Image from Purves et
   al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH
   Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   Enzymes can act rapidly, as in the case of carbonic anhydrase (enzymes typically end in the -ase
   suffix), which causes the chemicals to react 107 times faster than without the enzyme present.
   Carbonic anhydrase speeds up the transfer of carbon dioxide from cells to the blood. There are
   over 2000 known enzymes, each of which is involved with one specific chemical reaction. Enzymes
   are substrate specific. The enzyme peptidase (which breaks peptide bonds in proteins) will not
   work on starch (which is broken down by human-produced amylase in the mouth).

   Enzymes are proteins. The functioning of the enzyme is determined by the shape of the protein.
   The arrangement of molecules on the enzyme produces an area known as the active site within
   which the specific substrate(s) will "fit". It recognizes, confines and orients the substrate in
   a particular direction.

                                             [indfit.gif]

   (indicated by the red arrows) after glucose has fit into the binding or active site. Image from
   Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates
   (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   The induced fit hypothesis suggests that the binding of the substrate to the enzyme alters the
   structure of the enzyme, placing some strain on the substrate and further facilitating the
   reaction. Cofactors are nonproteins essential for enzyme activity. Ions such as K^+ and Ca^+2
   are cofactors. Coenzymes are nonprotein organic molecules bound to enzymes near the active site.
   NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).

   Enzymatic pathways form as a result of the common occurrence of a series of dependent chemical
   reactions. In one example, the end product depends on the successful completion of five
   reactions, each mediated by a specific enzyme. The enzymes in a series can be located adjacent
   to each other (in an organelle or in the membrane of an organelle), thus speeding the reaction
   process. Also, intermediate products tend not to accumulate, making the process more efficient.
   By removing intermediates (and by inference end products) from the reactive pathway, equilibrium
   (the tendency of reactions to reverse when concentrations of the products build up to a certain
   level) effects are minimized, since equilibrium is not attained, and so the reactions will
   proceed in the "preferred" direction.

                                           [metabolfbk.gif]

   Negative feedback and a metabolic pathway. The production of the end product (G) in sufficient
   quantity to fill the square feedback slot in the enzyme will turn off this pathway between step
   C and D. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer
   Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   Temperature: Increases in temperature will speed up the rate of nonenzyme mediated reactions,
   and so temperature increase speeds up enzyme mediated reactions, but only to a point. When
   heated too much, enzymes (since they are proteins dependent on their shape) become denatured.
   When the temperature drops, the enzyme regains its shape. Thermolabile enzymes, such as those
   responsible for the color distribution in Siamese cats and color camouflage of the Arctic fox,
   work better (or work at all) at lower temperatures.

   Concentration of substrate and product also control the rate of reaction, providing a
   biofeedback mechanism.

   Activation, as in the case of chymotrypsin, protects a cell from the hazards or damage the
   enzyme might cause.

   Changes in pH will also denature the enzyme by changing the shape of the enzyme. Enzymes are
   also adapted to operate at a specific pH or pH range.

   range of pH at which it is active as well as an optimal pH at which it is most active. Image

   (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   Allosteric Interactions may allow an enzyme to be temporarily inactivated. Binding of an
   allosteric effector changes the shape of the enzyme, inactivating it while the effector is still
   bound. Such a mechanism is commonly employed in feedback inhibition. Often one of the products,
   either an end or near-end product act as an allosteric effector, blocking or shunting the
   pathway.

                                           [allostery.gif]

   Competitive Inhibition works by the competition of the regulatory compound and substrate for the
   binding site. If enough regulatory compound molecules bind to enough enzymes, the pathway is
   shut down or at least slowed down. PABA, a chemical essential to a bacteria that infects
   animals, resembles a drug, sulfanilamide, that competes with PABA, shutting down an essential
   bacterial (but not animal) pathway.

   substrate; Bottom: specific case of succinate dehydrogenase and its natural substrate

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   Noncompetitive Inhibition occurs when the inhibitory chemical, which does not have to resemble
   the substrate, binds to the enzyme other than at the active site. Lead binds to SH groups in
   this fashion. Irreversible Inhibition occurs when the chemical either permanently binds to or
   massively denatures the enzyme so that the tertiary structure cannot be restored. Nerve gas
   permanently blocks pathways involved in nerve message transmission, resulting in death.
   Penicillin, the first of the "wonder drug" antibiotics, permanently blocks the pathways certain
   bacteria use to assemble their cell wall components.
