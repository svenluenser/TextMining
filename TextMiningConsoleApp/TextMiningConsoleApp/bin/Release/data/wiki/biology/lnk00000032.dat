The Cell Cycle | Back to Top

   Despite differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, there are several common features in
   their cell division processes. Replication of the DNA must occur. Segregation of the "original"
   and its "replica" follow. Cytokinesis ends the cell division process. Whether the cell was
   eukaryotic or prokaryotic, these basic events must occur.

   Cytokinesis is the process where one cell splits off from its sister cell. It usually occurs
   after cell division. The Cell Cycle is the sequence of growth, DNA replication, growth and cell
   division that all cells go through. Beginning after cytokinesis, the daughter cells are quite
   small and low on ATP. They acquire ATP and increase in size during the G1 phase of Interphase.
   Most cells are observed in Interphase, the longest part of the cell cycle. After acquiring
   sufficient size and ATP, the cells then undergo DNA Synthesis (replication of the original DNA
   molecules, making identical copies, one "new molecule" eventually destined for each new cell)
   which occurs during the S phase. Since the formation of new DNA is an energy draining process,
   the cell undergoes a second growth and energy acquisition stage, the G2 phase. The energy
   acquired during G2 is used in cell division (in this case mitosis).

   Regulation of the cell cycle is accomplished in several ways. Some cells divide rapidly (beans,
   for example take 19 hours for the complete cycle; red blood cells must divide at a rate of 2.5
   million per second). Others, such as nerve cells, lose their capability to divide once they
   reach maturity. Some cells, such as liver cells, retain but do not normally utilize their
   capacity for division. Liver cells will divide if part of the liver is removed. The division
   continues until the liver reaches its former size.

   Cancer cells are those which undergo a series of rapid divisions such that the daughter cells
   divide before they have reached "functional maturity". Environmental factors such as changes in
   temperature and pH, and declining nutrient levels lead to declining cell division rates. When
   cells stop dividing, they stop usually at a point late in the G1 phase, the R point (for
   restriction).

Prokaryotic Cell Division | Back to Top

   Prokaryotes are much simpler in their organization than are eukaryotes. There are a great many
   more organelles in eukaryotes, also more chromosomes. The usual method of prokaryote cell
   division is termed binary fission. The prokaryotic chromosome is a single DNA molecule that
   first replicates, then attaches each copy to a different part of the cell membrane. When the
   cell begins to pull apart, the replicate and original chromosomes are separated. Following cell
   splitting (cytokinesis), there are then two cells of identical genetic composition (except for
   the rare chance of a spontaneous mutation).

   This animated GIF of binary fission is from:

   The prokaryote chromosome is much easier to manipulate than the eukaryotic one. We thus know
   much more about the location of genes and their control in prokaryotes.

   One consequence of this asexual method of reproduction is that all organisms in a colony are
   genetic equals. When treating a bacterial disease, a drug that kills one bacteria (of a specific
   type) will also kill all other members of that clone (colony) it comes in contact with.

Eukaryotic Cell Division | Back to Top

   Due to their increased numbers of chromosomes, organelles and complexity, eukaryote cell
   division is more complicated, although the same processes of replication, segregation, and
   cytokinesis still occur.

Mitosis | Back to Top

   Mitosis is the process of forming (generally) identical daughter cells by replicating and
   dividing the original chromosomes, in effect making a cellular xerox. Commonly the two processes
   of cell division are confused. Mitosis deals only with the segregation of the chromosomes and
   organelles into daughter cells.

   Eukaryotic chromosomes occur in the cell in greater numbers than prokaryotic chromosomes. The
   condensed replicated chromosomes have several points of interest. The kinetochore is the point
   where microtubules of the spindle apparatus attach. Replicated chromosomes consist of two
   molecules of DNA (along with their associated histone proteins) known as chromatids. The area
   where both chromatids are in contact with each other is known as the centromere the kinetochores
   are on the outer sides of the centromere. Remember that chromosomes are condensed chromatin (DNA
   plus histone proteins).

   During mitosis replicated chromosomes are positioned near the middle of the cytoplasm and then
   segregated so that each daughter cell receives a copy of the original DNA (if you start with 46
   in the parent cell, you should end up with 46 chromosomes in each daughter cell). To do this
   cells utilize microtubules (referred to as the spindle apparatus) to "pull" chromosomes into
   each "cell". The microtubules have the 9+2 arrangement discussed earlier. Animal cells (except
   for a group of worms known as nematodes) have a centriole. Plants and most other eukaryotic
   organisms lack centrioles. Prokaryotes, of course, lack spindles and centrioles; the cell
   membrane assumes this function when it pulls the by-then replicated chromosomes apart during
   binary fission. Cells that contain centrioles also have a series of smaller microtubules, the
   aster, that extend from the centrioles to the cell membrane. The aster is thought to serve as a
   brace for the functioning of the spindle fibers.

   The phases of mitosis are sometimes difficult to separate. Remember that the process is a
   dynamic one, not the static process displayed of necessity in a textbook.

Prophase | Back to Top

   Prophase is the first stage of mitosis proper. Chromatin condenses (remember that chromatin/DNA
   replicate during Interphase), the nuclear envelope dissolves, centrioles (if present) divide and
   migrate, kinetochores and kinetochore fibers form, and the spindle forms.

Metaphase | Back to Top

   Metaphase follows Prophase. The chromosomes (which at this point consist of chromatids held
   together by a centromere) migrate to the equator of the spindle, where the spindles attach to
   the kinetochore fibers.

Anaphase | Back to Top

   Anaphase begins with the separation of the centromeres, and the pulling of chromosomes (we call
   them chromosomes after the centromeres are separated) to opposite poles of the spindle.

Telophase | Back to Top

   Telophase is when the chromosomes reach the poles of their respective spindles, the nuclear
   envelope reforms, chromosomes uncoil into chromatin form, and the nucleolus (which had
   disappeared during Prophase) reform. Where there was one cell there are now two smaller cells
   each with exactly the same genetic information. These cells may then develop into different
   adult forms via the processes of development.

Cytokinesis | Back to Top

   Cytokinesis is the process of splitting the daughter cells apart. Whereas mitosis is the
   division of the nucleus, cytokinesis is the splitting of the cytoplasm and allocation of the
   golgi, plastids and cytoplasm into each new cell.
