   macroevolution  The combination of events associated with the origin, diversification,
   extinction, and interactions of organisms which produced the species that currently inhabit the
   Earth. Large scale evolutionary change such as the evolution of new species (or even higher
   taxa) and extinction of species.

   macromolecules  Large molecules made up of many small organic molecules that are often referred
   to as monomers; e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Macromolecules are
   polymers of monomers.

   macronucleus In ciliates, the large nucleus that carries up to several hundred copies of the
   genome and controls metabolism and asexual reproduction. PICTURE

   macronutrients 1. Elements needed by plants in relatively large (primary) or smaller (secondary)
   quantities. 2. Foods needed by animals daily or on a fairly regular basis.

   macrophages  A type of white blood cell derived from monocytes that engulf invading antigenic
   molecules, viruses, and microorganisms and then display fragments of the antigen to activate
   helper T cells; ultimately stimulating the production of antibodies against the antigen. PICTURE

   malleus One of the bones comprising the middle ear of mammals.

   Malpighian tubules  The excretory organs of insects; a set of long tubules that open into the
   gut. PICTURE

   mammal-like reptiles Group of Permian-Triassic reptiles having some possible mammalian features,
   notably a more prominent dentary (tooth-bearing) bone and reduction of the incus and malleus

   mammals g-laying and placental being the other two), marsupials finish development in a pouch or
   under hairy coverings attached to the mother.

   than 50% of all species then living become extinct; results in a marked decrease in the
   diversity of organisms. Mass extinctions are thought to have occurred numerous times in Earth
   history, often from a variety of reasons: impacts, tectonism, changes in primary productivity of

   the centromeres of the chromosomes and help draw the chromosomes apart during anaphase. PICTURE
