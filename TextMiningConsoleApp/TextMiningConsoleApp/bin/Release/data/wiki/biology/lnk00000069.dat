   Traditional classifications have placed the archea and bacteria into a single taxonomic kingdom
   due to theri morphological similarity. In fact the two groups are extremely different, as
   different from each other biochemically as eukaryotes are from either group. Under the recently
   devised domain system, the achaea and bacteria are placed into two separate domains, with the
   third one containing all the eukaryotes. This system is shown in Figure 1.

  Domain Bacteria (Eubacteria) | Back to Top

   The old taxonomic Kingdom Monera consisted of the bacteria (meaning the true bacteria and
   cyanobacteria, or photosynthetic bacteria) as well as the archea. The modern classification, see
   Figure 1, seprates each of these groups to separate domain status.

   Organisms in the Domain Bacteria lack membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus and
   endoplasmic reticulum that typify the third domain, the Eukaryota. All members of Domain
   bacteria are prokaryotes. Bacteria (technically the Eubacteria) and blue-green bacteria (the
   blue-green algae when I was a student back in the 1970s), or cyanobacteria are the major forms
   of life in this domain, examples of which are shown in Figure 2.

   Their small size, ability to rapidly reproduce (for example, the intestinal bacterium E. coli
   can reproduce by binary fission every 15 minutes), and diverse habitats/modes of existence make
   bacteria the most abundant and diversified group of organisms on (and under!) the Earth.
   Bacteria occur in almost every environment on Earth, from the bottom of the ocean floor, deep
   inside solid rock, to the cooling jackets of nuclear reactors. Possible bacteria-like structures
   have even been recovered from 3 billion year old Martian meteorites. If these turn out to be
   fossils (and as of 2002 it seems likely they are NOT), then the bacterial form of life would
   have existed simultaneously on both Earth and Mars. However, the cellular nature of the Martian
   structures has not been conclusively established.

  Bacterial Structure | Back to Top

   Bacteria, since they are prokaryotes, lack a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles.
   Biochemical processes that normally occur in a choloroplast or mitochondrion of eukaryotes will
   take place in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes. Bacterial DNA is circular and arrayed in a region of
   the cell known as the nucleoid, shown in Figure 3. Scattered within bacterial cytoplasm are
   numerous small loops of DNA known as plasmids. Bacterial genes are organized in by gene systems
   known as operons. The cytoplasm also contains numerous ribosomes, the structures where proteins
   are assembled. All bacteria also have a cell membrane, as well as a cell wall, as shown in
   Figure 4.

   Figure 3. Note the nucleoid region (n) where DNA is located as well as the electron dense areas
   of the cytoplasm (dark areas) on these two cells of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This image is from:

   As a group, bacteria are nutritionally quite diverse. Some bacteria are photosynthetic
   autotrophs, while others are heterotrophs. Bacteria play important ecological roles as
   decomposers, as well as important elements of phytoplantonic organisms at the base of many food
   chains.

   Plasmids are small DNA fragments known from almost all bacterial cells. These plasmids may carry
   between two and thirty genes. Some plasmids seem to have the ability to move in and out of the
   bacterial chromosome. As such they are important tools to the biotechnology arsenal.

   The operon model of prokaryotic gene regulation was proposed by Fancois Jacob and Jacques Monod.
   Groups of genes coding for related proteins are arranged in units known as operons, as
   illustrated by Figure 5. An operon consists of an operator, promoter, regulator, and structural
   genes. The regulator gene codes for a repressor protein that binds to the operator, obstructing
   the promoter (thus, transcription) of the structural genes. The regulator does not have to be
   adjacent to other genes in the operon. If the repressor protein is removed, transcription may
   occur.

   Operons are either inducible or repressible according to the control mechanism. Seventy-five
   different operons controlling 250 structural genes have been identified for E. coli.

   Bacteria have flagella, shown in Figure 6, although the bacterial flagellum has a different
   microtubule structure than the flagella of eukaryotes. Cell walls of bacteria contain the
   peptidoglycan instead of the cellulose found in cell walls of plants and some algae. Ribosomes
   are the structures in cells where proteins are assembled. Bacterial ribosomes have different
   sized ribosomal subunits than do eukaryotes.

   Bacteria typically have one of three shapes: rods (bacilli), spheres (cocci) or spiral
   (spirilla). These shaps are shown in Figures 7 and 8. Unicellular, they often stick together
   forming clumps or filaments.

  Bacterial Reproduction | Back to Top

   Prokaryotes are much simpler in their organization than are eukaryotes. There are a great many
   more organelles in eukaryotes, as well as more chromosomes to be moved around during cell
   division. The typical method of prokaryote cell division is binary fission, shown in the
   animated GIF below as well as in Figure 10. The prokaryotic chromosome is a single DNA molecule
   that first replicates, then attaches each copy to a different part of the cell membrane. When
   the cell begins to pull apart, the two chromosomes thus are separated. Following cell splitting
   (cytokinesis), there are now two cells of identical genetic composition (except for the rare
   chance of a spontaneous mutation).

                                             [69091a.jpg]

   One consequence of this asexual method of reproduction is that all bacterial cells in a colony
   are genetically the same. When treating a bacterial disease, a drug that kills one bacteria of a
   specific type will normally kill all other members of that clone (colony) it comes in contact
   with. Evolution requires genetic variation on which to operate. How then can bacteria increase
   their genetic variation if their typical mode of reproduction produces clones?

   Bacteria can accomplish genetic recombination in three ways. Conjugation, shown in Figures 11
   and 12, is the process where one bacterium passes DNA to another through a tube (the sex pilus)
   that temporarily joins the two conjugating cells. Conjugation occurs only between bacteria in
   same or closely related species. Transformation involves a bacterium taking up free pieces of
   DNA secreted by live bacteria or released by dead bacteria. into the surrounding environment.
   Recall that Griffith's experiment demonstrated this process. The third process, transduction,
   happens when bacteriophage transfer portions of bacterial DNA from one cell to another.

   Certain types of bacteria can "donate" a piece of the their DNA to a recipient cell. The
   recombination is the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. Note that the
   entire DNA is not usually transferred, only a small piece.

   Plasmids sometimes carry genes for resistance to antibiotics. Since they are also DNA, plasmids
   can be transferred between bacteria by any of the three processes mentioned above. Since genetic
   recombination does not routinely happen (as it does in sexually reproducing eukaryotes),
   mutation is the most important source of genetic variation for evolutionary change. Normally
   bacteria have short generation times, mutations are generated and distributed throughout
   bacterial populations more quickly than in eukaryotes. Prokaryotes have only a single
   chromosome, which makes them haploid. Consequently, mutations are not hidden by a dominant
   allele, and will be expressed and evaluated by natural selection more rapidly than in diploid
   eukaryotes.

   Endospores are a method of survival, not one of reproduction. The formation of an endospore is
   shown in Figure 13. Certain bacteria will form a spore inside their cell membrane (an endospore)
   that allows them to wait out deteriorating environmental conditions. A small portion of
   cytoplasm and a chromosome copy are surrounded by three heavy, protective spore coats. The part
   of the bacterial cell outside the endospore deteriorates and the endospore is released.
   Endospores allow bacteria that produce them to survive in the harshest of environments. When
   conditions once again become suitable, the endospore absorbs water and grows out of its spore
   coat.

   Certain disease causing bacteria (such as Bacillus anthracis, the cause of the disease anthrax)
   can be virulent (capable of causing an infection) for up to 1300 years after forming their
   endospore! Because of this, as well as other factors, the anthrax bacterium has been considered
   as a possible biological weapon. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, several
   people died from anthrax exposure, and one postal facility was closed (as was the U.S. Senate
   building) for several weeks. As of March 2003, no connection between these events has been
   definitely established.

  Classification of Bacteria | Back to Top

   Bacteria are classified on the basis of their method of energy acquisition. Traditional
   classifications include chemosynthetic, photosynthetic, and heterotrophic groups. Molecular and
   cladistic studies are reshaping these traditional groups. In the absence of a consensus the
   traditional groups are employed here..

    Chemosynthetic Bacteria

   Chemosynthetic bacteria are autotrophic, and obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic
   compounds such as ammonia, nitrite (to nitrate), or sulfur (to sulfate).

    Photosynthetic Bacteria

   Photosynthetic bacteria carry out conversion of sunlight energy into carbohydrate energy.
   Cyanobacteria, an example of which is shown in Figure 13, are the major group of photosynthetic
   bacteria. Some early cyanobacteria may have formed the oxygen released into the early
   atmosphere, transforming our planet from one with an oxygen-free atmosphere, to the modern one
   that has a significant amount of oxygen present.. In addition to chlorophyll a, cyanobacteria
   also have the blue pigment phycocyanin and the red pigment phycoerythrin.

   Figure 13. Filamentous cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. (SEM x5,000). This image is copyright Dennis
   Kunkel at www.DennisKunkel.com, used with permission.

                                             [84150f.jpg]

   Eukaryotic autotrophs all have chloroplasts in which the photosynthetic process occurs. The
   typical chloroplast organization has thylakoids surrounded by a fluid-like stroma. The
   chloroplast is a membrane bound organelle. Prokaryotes by definition lack such structures. How
   can bacteria carry out photosynthesis? The answer is shown in Figure 14. By infolding their cell
   membrane, prokaryotic autotrophs form thylakoids, in effect turning the bacterium into a single
   chloroplast.

   Figure 14 Prochloron, a photosynthetic bacterium that illustrates that even though they lack
   chloroplasts, photosynthetic bacteria have infoldings of the cell membrane that form thylakoids
   inside the cell's cytoplasm. . TEM, magnification not known. Image from
   http://tidepool.st.usm.edu/pix/prochloron.gif.

                                          [01prochloron.gif]

   More primitive photosynthesizing bacteria (e.g., green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur
   bacteria) use only photosystem I that contains bacteriochlorophyll. In this style of
   photosynthesis, no O[2] is formed, since hydrogen sulfide (H[2]S) is used as an electron and H^+
   donor instead of H[2]O.

    Heterotrophic Bacteria

   Members of this large and diverse group must derive their energy from another organism by
   feeding. Two main types: saprophytic and symbiotic. Saprophytes feed on dead or decaying
   material and are important nutrient recyclers. Symbiotic bacteria live within a host
   multicellular organism and contribute to the health of the host. Examples include cows and other
   grazing animals: the bacteria convert cellulose from plant leaves and stems eaten by the animal
   into glucose for digestion by the animal. Normally cellulose is nondigestible.

   Possible symbiosis of bacteria within early eukaryotic cells was a major step in the evolution
   of eukaryotic cells. In 1980, Lynn Margulis proposed the theory of endosymbiosis, diagrammed in
   Figure 15, to explain the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts from permanent resident
   prokaryotes. According to this idea, a larger prokaryote (or perhaps early eukaryote) engulfed
   or surrounded a smaller prokaryote some 1.5 billion to 700 million years ago.

   Figure 15. Steps in endosymbiosis. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th
   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with
   permission.

                                           [endosymbio.gif]

   Instead of digesting the smaller organisms the large one and the smaller one entered into a type
   of symbiosis known as mutualism, where both organisms benefit and neither is harmed. The larger
   organism gained excess ATP provided by the "protomitochondrion" and excess sugar provided by the
   "protochloroplast", while providing a stable environment and the raw materials the endosymbionts
   required. This is so strong that now eukaryotic cells cannot survive without mitochondria
   (likewise photosynthetic eukaryotes cannot survive without chloroplasts), and the endosymbionts
   cannot survive outside their hosts. Nearly all eukaryotes have mitochondria. Mitochondrial
   division is remarkably similar to the prokaryotic methods that will be studied later in this
   course. A summary of the theory is available by clicking here.

   A vital symbiosis that bacteria seem to have participated in for hundreds of millions of years
   is their relationship with plants, both as soil nitrogen-fixing bacteria, as well as internal
   guests in the root nodules of plants of the pea family. Most organisms cannot use atmospheric
   nitrogen (N[2]) directly. Some bacteria have the metabolic pathways to convert inorganic N[2]
   into various forms of organic nitrogen. Mutualistic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium,
   live in nodules on the roots of soybean, clover, and alfalfa plants (all members of the pea
   family, Fabaceae), where they reduce N[2] to ammonia (NH[4]) to the benefit of both themselves
   as well as their their host. These bacteria also benefit by using some of a plant's
   photosynthetically produced organic molecules.

   Plants need nitrogen for many important biological molecules including nucleotides and proteins.
   However, the nitrogen in the atmosphere is not in a form that plants can utilize. Many plants
   have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria growing in their roots: organic nitrogen as rent for
   space to live, as shown in Figure 16. These plants tend to have root nodules in which the
   nitrogen-fixing bacteria live.

   legumes (the pea family), where bacteria live symbiotically with the plant. Images from Purves

   All the nitrogen in living systems was at one time processed by these types of bacteria, which
   took atmospheric nitrogen (N[2]) and modified it to a form that living things could utilize
   (such as NO[3] or NO[4]; or even as ammonia, NH[3] in the example shown below in Figure 17).

   Not all bacteria utilize the above route of nitrogen fixation. Many that live free in the soil,
   utilize other chemical pathways, as shown in Figure 18.

   Many heterotrophic bacteria also cause diseases such as strep throat, rheumatic fever, cholera,
   gonorrhea, syphilis, and toxic shock syndrome. Bacteria can cause disease by destroying cells,
   releasing toxins, contaminating food, or by the reaction of the body to the infecting bacteria.
   Bacterial infections can be controlled by vaccinations and antibiotic treatments. Antibiotics
   interfere with some aspect of the replication of bacteria, and are produced by microorganisms
   such as fungi, that compete with bacteria for resources. Penicillin, the first antibiotic
   discovered, inhibits the synthesis of new cell walls in certain types of bacteria. However, the
   overuse of antibiotics during the past fifty years has led to natural selection favoring
   antibiotic resistance. There are reportedly more than 50 strains of antibiotic resistant
   bacteria, necessitating the development of new antibiotics and the frequent change of
   antibiotics in treatment.

   Peptic ulcers result when these protective mechanisms fail. Bleeding ulcers result when tissue
   damage is so severe that bleeding occurs into the stomach. Perforated ulcers are
   life-threatening situations where a hole has formed in the stomach wall. At least 90% of all
   peptic ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori. Other factors, including stress and aspirin,
   can also produce ulcers.

   Gonorrhea and syphilis are among the most common bacterially caused sexually transmitted
   diseases. Both can be treated and cured with antibiotics, once diagnosed. Once considered likely
   to result in death, syphilis is usually curable with antibiotics, although overuse of
   antibiotics can reduce their effectiveness.

   Treponema pallidum is the bacterial species that causes syphilis. Syphilis is transmitted from
   an infected person to an uninfected one by direct contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal,
   anal, or oral sex. Proper use of condoms has been shown to reduce the incidence of syphilis.
   Syphilis sores occur mainly on the genitals, vagina, anus, or in the rectum, as well as on the
   lips and inside the mouth. Infected, pregnant women can pass it to their unborn child. The urban
   myth about getting this disease from a toilet seat is untrue. Syphilis cannot be spread by
   toilet seats, door knobs, swimming pools, hot tubs, bath tubs, or sharing of clothing or eating
   utensils. There are three stages to the disease. The prim,ary stage is the time between
   infection and the start of the first symptom, ranging from 10-90 days. The primary stage
   normally in indicated by the appearance of a single sore also known as a chancre. The chancre is
   usually round, firm, small and painless, and appears where syphilis entered the body. If proper
   treatment is not utilized, the diease moves into the secondary stage. The second stage occurs
   when some area(s) of the skin develop an itchless rash. Rashes can appear as the chancre is
   fading or can be delayed for weeks. The rash often appears as rough, red or reddish brown spots
   both on the palms of the hands and on the bottoms of the feet. The rash also may also appear on
   other parts of the body.. Even without treatment, rashes clear up on their own. In addition to
   rashes, second-stage symptoms can include fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, patchy hair
   loss, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches, and tiredness. The disease can pass to sex partners
   when primary or secondary stage symptoms are showing. The latent, or hidden, stage of syphilis
   initiates when the symptoms of the second stage disappear. Without treatment, an infected
   individual still has syphilis, even though he or she does not display symptoms. Treponema
   pallidum remains in the body, and so may begin to damage internal organs, suc as the brain,
   nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints. This internal damage may not show
   up until many years later when the person enters the late or tertiary stage of syphilis. Late
   stage symptoms include the inability to coordinate muscle movements, paralysis, numbness,
   gradual blindness and dementia. This damage may be serious enough to cause death. Because of
   this progress of ther disease, often resulting in death, the disease was one greatly feared
   before the advent of antibiotics.

   Gonorrhea is another common sexually transmitted disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a
   bacterium. This bacterium can grow in the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus, and
   fallopian tubes in women, as well as in the urethra in both men and women. The bacteria can also
   grow in the mouth, throat, and anus. Gonorrhea is spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sexual
   contact. Ejaculation does not have to occur for gonorrhea to be transmitted or acquired.
   Gonorrhea can also be transmitted during birth. Symptoms include a burning sensation during
   urination and a yellowish white discharge from the penis. Some infected males may have painful
   or swollen testicles. Many women often do not show strong signs of the early symptoms of
   gonorrhea. The initial symptoms for women include a painful or burning sensation upon urination,
   as well as a yellow or occasionally bloody vaginal discharg. Women with no or mild gonorrhea
   symptoms are still at risk of developing serious complications from the infection. Untreated
   gonorrhea in women can develop into pelvic inflammatory disease. Rectal infection has symptoms
   such as discharge, anal itching, soreness, bleeding, and sometimes painful bowel movements.
   Infections in the throat cause few symptoms. Penicillin is a common antibiotic no longer used to
   treat gonorrhea due to the development of penicillin-resistant strains of the gonorrhea
   bacterium.

   Salmonella is a genus of rod-shaped bacterium whose species cause typoind fever and similar
   illnesses. The bacteria of this genus are widespread in animals, especially in poultry and pigs.
   Environmental sources of the organism include water, soil, insects, kitchen surfaces, feces, and
   raw meat, seafood, and poultry.


  The Archea | Back to Top

   The most primitive group, the archaebacteria, are today restricted to marginal habitats such as
   hot springs or areas of low oxygen concentration. Archaebacteria (now more commonly referred to
   as the Archaea) are considered among the oldest and most primitive types of organisms known.
   They have significant differences in their cell walls and biochemistry when compared to the
   bacteria. These differences are sufficient in most schemes, to place the Archaea into a separate
   kingdom or domain. Under the three domain model, they are the taxonomic equivalents of the other
   bacteria and the eukaryotes. It is thought that since bacteria and Archaea inhabit some of the
   modern environments thought by paleontologists to resemble what the early Earth was like, that
   both are descended from a common ancestor. The Eukarya later split from the Archaea.

   The archeans are life's extremists, occupying environments that "normal" organisms find too
   harsh. Three types of archaebacteria: methanogens, halophiles, and thermacidophiles. They live
   in extreme habitats.

   Figure 19. Sulfolobus acidocaldarius , an extreme thermophile occurs in geothermally-heated acid
   springs, mud pots and surface soils; it can withstand temperatures from 60 to 95 degrees C, and
   a pH of 1 to 5. Left: Electron micrograph of a thin section (X85,000); Right: Fluorescent
   photomicrograph of cells attached to a sulfur crystal. The image above is from

   The methanogens are chemosynthetic archeans that produce methane (CH[4]) from hydrogen gas and
   CO[2]. Both ATP synthesis and CO[2] reduction are linked to this reaction. Methanogens can
   decompose animal wastes to produce methane, which can be collected and combusted to make
   ecological friendly electricity. Pollutants from methane combustion are much fewer than from
   combustion of coal.

   There are three groups of Archaea. The methanogens live under anaerobic environments (e.g.,
   marshes) where they produce methane. Halophiles require high salt concentrations (such as in
   Utah's Great Salt Lake). Thermoacidophiles live under hot, acidic environments (like those found
   in geysers).

  The Fossil Record | Back to Top

   Fossil evidence supports the origins of life on earth earlier than 3.5 billion years ago.
   Specimens from the North Pole region of Western Australia are of such diversity and apparent
   complexity that even more primitive cells must have existed earlier. Rocks of the Ishua Super
   Group in Greenland yield possibly the fossil remains of the earliest cells, 3.8 billion years
   old. The oldest known rocks on earth are 3.96 Ga and are from Arctic Canada. Thus, life appears
   to have begun soon after the cooling of the earth and formation of the atmosphere and oceans.

   These ancient fossils occur in marine rocks, such as limestones and sandstones, that formed in
   ancient oceans. The organisms living today that are most similar to ancient life forms are the
   archaebacteria (the archaea in modern usage). This group is today restricted to marginal
   environments. Recent discoveries of bacteria at mid-ocean ridges add yet another possible origin
   for life: at these mid-ocean ridges where heat and molten rock rise to the earth's surface.

   Many of the ancient phototrophs and heterotrophic bacteria lived in colonial associations known
   as stromatolites. Cyanobacteria are on the outer surface, with other photosynjthetic bacteria
   (anoxic) below them. Below these phottrophs are layers of heterotrophic bacteria. The layers in
   the stromatolites are alternating biogenic and sedimentologic in origin. A modern day
   stromatolite is shown in Figure 20.

   structures, and a closeup of the cyanobacteria that make up the bulk of the feature. Image from
