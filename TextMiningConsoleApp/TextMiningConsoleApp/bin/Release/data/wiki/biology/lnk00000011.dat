   eccrine glands  Sweat glands that are linked to the sympathetic nervous system and are widely
   distributed over the body surface.

   ecological niche  The role an organism occupies and the function it performs in an ecosystem;
   closely associated with feeding.

   ecological time  A timescale that focuses on community events that occur on the order of tens to
   hundreds of years.

   ecology  The study of how organisms interact with each other and their physical environment.

   ecosystem  The community living in an area and its physical environment.

   ecotones  Well-deÞned boundaries typical of closed communities.

   ecotype  A subdivision of a species; a stage in the formation of a species such that
   reproductive isolation has occurred.

   ectotherms  Animals with a variable body temperature that is determined by the environment.
   Examples: fish, frogs, and reptiles.

   effector  In a closed system, the element that initiates an action in response to a signal from
   a sensor. In human systems, a muscle or gland often serves as an effector.

   ejaculatory duct  In males, a short duct that connects the vas deferens from each testis to the

   electron  A subatomic particle with a negative charge. Electrons circle the atom's nucleus in
   regions of space known as orbitals.

   electron acceptor  A molecule that forms part of the electron transport system that transfers
   electrons ejected by chlorophyll during photosynthesis. Part of the energy carried by the
   electrons is transferred to ATP, part is transferred to NADPH, and part is lost in the transfer
   system.

   electron transport 1) A series of coupled oxidation/reduction reactions where electrons are
   passed like hot potatoes from one membrane-bound protein/enzyme to another before being finally
   attached to a terminal electron acceptor (usually oxygen or NADPH). ATP is formed by this
   process. 2) coupled series of oxidation/reduction reactions during which ATP is generated by
   energy transfer as electrons move from high reducing state to lower reducing state. PICTURE 1 |

   reactants.

   endotherms  Animals that have the ability to maintain a constant body temperature over a wide
   range of environmental conditions.

   energy flow  The movement of energy through a community via feeding relationships.

   energy of activation  The minimum amount of energy required for a given reaction to occur;
   varies from reaction to reaction. PICTURE

   entropy  The degree of disorder in a system. As energy is transferred from one form to another,
   some is lost as heat; as the energy decreases, the disorder in the system—and thus the
   entropy—increases.

   enzymes  Protein molecules that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions. PICTURE

   eon The longest umit of geological time.

   epidermis  1. The outermost layer of skin consisting of several layers of epithelial
   cells—notably, keratinocytes—and, in the inner layer of the epidermis, basal cells and

   occurs; usually extends to about 200 meters below the water surface.

   eutrophication  "Runaway" growth of aquatic plants that occurs when agricultural fertilizers

   trilobites) and human-induced (dodo, passenger pigeon, liberals [:)]) means.
