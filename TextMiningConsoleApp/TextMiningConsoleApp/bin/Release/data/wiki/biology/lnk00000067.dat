  Biological Diversity and Classification

   Taxonomy is that branch of biology dealing with the identification and naming of organisms. The
   ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle apparently began the discussion on taxonomy. British
   naturalist John Ray is credited with revising the concept of naming and describing organisms.
   During the 1700s, Swedish botanist Carolus Linneus classified all then-known organisms into two
   large groups: the kingdoms Plantae and Animalia. Robert Whittaker in 1969 proposed five
   kingdoms: Plantae, Animalia, Fungi, Protista, and Monera. Other schemes involving an even
   greater number of kingdoms have lately been proposed, however most biologists employ Whittaker's
   five kingdoms. Recent studies suggest that three domains be employed: Archaea, Bacteria, and
   Eukarya. The classification of a rose is shown in Figure 1, while that of a warbler is
   illustrated in Figure 2.

   taxonomic ranks. Kingdoms have a great deal more types of creatures in them than do species.

   Linneus attempted to pigeon-hole (or classify) all known species of his time (1753). Linnean
   hierarchical classification was based on the premise that the species was the smallest unit, and
   that each species (or taxon) nested within a higher category.

   Kingdom Animalia

     Phylum (Division for plants) Chordata

     Class Mammalia

     Order Primates

     Family Hominidae

     Genus Homo

     species sapiens

   Linneus also developed the concept of binomial nomenclature, whereby scientists speaking and
   writing different languages could communicate clearly. For example Man in English is Hombre in
   Spanish, Herr in German, Ren in Chinese, and Homo in Latin. Linneus settled on Latin, which was
   the language of learned men at that time. If a scientist refers today to Homo, all scientists
   know what organism/taxon he or she means.

Construction of Phylogenetic Trees | Back to Top

   Taxonomy is part of a larger division of biology known as systematics. Determination of
   phylogeny is a goal of systematics. This is done by the construction of phylogenetic trees,
   which in a sense represent evolutionary hypotheses and attempts to define monophyletic groups.
   To build these trees, we must have data, which comes from the characteristics used in
   classification. There are several methods of classification: traditional, phentic, and
   cladistic. They differ in how they value certain characters. Let's consider how traditional
   classification treats reptiles, birds, and mammals, as shown in Figure 3.

   Figure 3. Traditional classification of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Image from Purves et al.,

                                           [tradclass.gif]

    Traditional Classification

   Data used in traditional systematics stresses both common ancestry (monophylesis) and the amount
   of divergence among groups. The traditional, dating to Linneaus view, is that birds have
   feathers, reptiles have scales, and mammals have hair. Using this as a major character, a
   classification like that above has been constructed. Fossils, evidence of past life, are not
   included in this classification. Since all of these groups have the amniotic egg, or a
   modification of it, they would be united in a larger taxon. Linneus placed each of these groups
   in a separate class within the Phylum Chordata. A primitive character is one present in the
   common ancestor and all members of the group, such as the amniotic egg. A derived character is
   one found only in a particular lineage within the larger group. In our example above, hair and
   feathers may be viewed as derived characters. A traditional view of our example group is that
   birds and mammals evolved from reptiles due to their unique derived characters.

    Cladistics and Cladograms

   Cladistics is a type of systematics developed by the late German biologist Willi Hennig, who
   attempted to formulate a more objective method of classifying organisms. Cladists group
   organisms based on the presence of shared derived characters, not the overall similarity of
   potential group members. In the example cited in Figure 3, the amniotic egg would be used to
   unite a group sharing common ancestry, since it would NOT be present in a group that was not in
   the lineage. The use of feathers and hair to separate birds and mammals from reptiles would NOT
   factor into a cladistic hypothesis, or cladogram, since these are characters unique to only one
   taxon in our group. Such an approach is shown in Figure 4.

   The value of cladistics lies in its capacity to generate (and provide a set of criteria for the
   evaluation) of multiple hypotheses (alternate cladograms) that can be evaluated with additional
   data. Almost always the "correct" cladogram employs the principle of parsimony, which proposes
   that the shortest number of steps or character state changes is most likely correct. An
   important question....is evolution always parsimonmious? However the ultimate answer to that
   question unfolds, the rigor cladistics introduces to systematics is useful in getting
   traditional systematists to look at their subjective classifications in a new light. On the
   diagram shown in Figure 5, shared derived characters are indicated as hauchers across the lines.
   The mammal clade (in this case represented by mouse and chimpanzee) is united by fur, the
   lizard, pigeon, mouse-chimp clade is united by claws or nails, etc.

    Cladistic Classification

   The example used above, if treated cladistically, would produce a very different classification!
   Note that crocodiles have more in common (in a cladistic sense) with birds than they do with
   other reptiles. Birds and crocs form a clade, or monophyletic group united by shared derived
   characters not present in the other groups. If we construct a Linnean group from this cladogram,
   we have a class of birds and crocodiles, a second class of lizards, snakes, and turtles, and a
   third class of mammals, as shown in Figure 6.

    Figure 6. Cladistic-based classification of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Note the changes
    betweeen the cladistic and traditional classifications as shown in Figure 3. Image from Purves
    et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and

                                           [cladclass_2.gif]

   One of the more interesting applications of cladistics is to the question of the pandas. The
   giant panda was once thought to be a bear, but later its racoon-like characters caused it to be
   placed closer to racoons. The red (lesser) panda lives in the same areas of China as the giant
   panda, but has a far greater similarity with racoons, as shown in Figure 7. DNA hybridization
   studies suggest the giant panda is in the bear clade, while the red panda is in the racoon
   clade. Both share a common ancestry, as indicated by shared derived characters, followed by
   convergent evolution of other characters. The diagram above indicates this divergence from
   common ancestry, and even attempts to show the time of that divergence.

   been added onthe horizontal scale after the cladistic analysis was done. Image from Purves et

    Phenetics

   Phenetics is a process by which taxa are clustered together based on the number of their
   similarities (or differences, depending on the numerical coefficient employed). Traits are
   measured and either converted into integers or input directly as numerical data. Theses data are
   then mathematically processed using an algorithm that generates a similarity (or distance as the
   case may be) matrix. Various graphical representations of this matrix include a phenogram, and
   principal coordinate plot. Phenetic classifications are plagued by problems of convergence and
   parallelism, but are useful in their attempt to objectify the classification process. My
   previous work on triprojectate pollen employed phenetics to deal with a wide array of subjective
   ratios or other classification methods. Convergence was a given with this group of fossil pollen
   produced by one or more groups of unknown extinct plants. Since monophylesis could not be
   established for the entire group, phenetics was use to help delineate possible monophyletic
   groups for eventual cladistic study.

Nomenclature | Back to Top

   The naming of species and other taxa follows a set of rules, the International Code of Botanical
   Nomenclature (ICBN, click here for an online version) for plants, the International Code of
   Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) for animals.

   Some general rules for nomenclature:
    1. All taxa must belong to a higher taxonomic group. Often a newly discovered organism is the
       sole species in a single genus, within a single family...etc.
    2. The first name to be validly and effectively published has priority. This rule has caused
       numerous name changes, especially with fossil organisms: Brontosaurus is invalid, and the
       correct name for the big sauropod dinosaur is Apatosaurus, Eohippus (the tiny "dawn horse")
       is invalid and should be referred to as Hyracotherium. Sometime, however, names can be
       conserved if a group of systematists agrees.
    3. All taxa must have an author. When you see a scientific name such as Homo sapiens L, the L
       stands for Linneus, who first described and named that organism. Most scientists must have
       their names spelled out, for example Libopollis jarzenii Farabee et al. (an interesting
       fossil pollen type I stumbled across a very long time ago!).

The Kingdoms of Life | Back to Top

   Linnaeus originally placed all living things into either the plant or animal kingdoms. As
   scientists learned more about the biology of many organisms, this constraining into two kingdoms
   became less and less defensible.

   Evolutionary theory and the cell theory provide us with a basis for the interrelation of all
   living things. We also utilize Linneus' hierarchical classification system, adopting (generally)
   five kingdoms of living organisms. Viruses, as discussed later, are not considered living.
   Recent studies suggest that there might be a sixth Kingdom, the Archaea.

     (Eubacteria), and Eukaryota (all eukaryotic groups: Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia).

                                              [kingdoms.gif]


   Monera

   Monera are the only kingdom composed of prokaryotic organisms, they have a cell wall, and lack
   both membrane-bound organelles and multicellular forms. The Archaebacteria, the most ancient of
   this kingdom, are so different that they may belong to a separate kingdom. Other groups of
   Monera include the cyanobacteria (autotrophic) and eubacteria (heterotrophic).

   Protista

   The most ancient eukaryotic kingdom, protists include a variety of eukaryotic body
   (single-celled-colonial-multicellular?) and nutritional heterotrophic, autotrophic, and both)
   forms. Perhaps they are best defined as eukaryotes that are NOT fungi, animals, or plants.

   Fungi

   Fungi are a eukaryotic, heterotrophic, usually multicellular group having multinucleated cells
   enclosed in cells with cell walls. They obtain their energy by decomposing dead and dying
   organisms and absorbing their nutrients from those organisms. Some fungi also cause disease
   (yeast infections, rusts, and smuts), while others are useful in baking, brewing, as foods,
   drugs and sources for antibiotics.

   Plantae

   Plants are immobile, multicellular eukaryotes that produce their food by photosynthesis and have
   cells encased in cellulose cell walls. Plants are important sources of oxygen, food, and
   clothing/construction materials, as well as pigments, spices, dyes, and drugs.

   Animalia

   Animals are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes that are capable of mobility at some stage
   during their lives, and that have cells lacking cell walls. Animals provide food, clothing,
   fats, scents, companionship, and labor.
