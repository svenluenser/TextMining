Organization of the Animal Body | Back to Top

   Animals are multicellular heterotrophs whose cells lack cell walls. At some point during their
   lives, all animals are capable of movement, although not all animals have muscles they use for
   this. In the most commonly encountered animals, the mobile stage is the adult, although some
   animals (such as corals and sponges) have sessile (or nonmobile) adult phases and mobile
   juvenile forms. Both animal and plant evolutionary history show the development of
   multicellularity and the move from water to land (as well as a secondary adaptation back to
   water, for example dolphins, whales, duckweed, and elodea).

   Animals developed external or internal skeletons to provide support, skin to prevent or lessen
   water loss, muscles that allowed them to move in search of food, brains and nervous systems for
   integration of stimuli, and internal digestive systems.

   Organs in animals are composed of a number of different tissue types. For example, the stomach
   shown in Figure 1, has epithelial tissue making linings and secreting gastric juices, connective
   tissues

   Plants are simpler organisms than animals, having three organ systems and fewer organs than do
   vertebrate animals. Organs are composed of tissues, which are in turn composed of cells. Plants
   have three tissue types: ground, dermal, and vascular. Animals have four: epithelial,
   connective, muscle, and bone.

  Epithelial Tissue | Back to Top

   Epithelial tissue covers body surfaces and lines body cavities. Functions include lining,
   protecting, and forming glands. Three types of epithelium occur:
     * Squamous epithelium is flattened cells.
     * Cuboidal epithelium is cube-shaped cells.
     * Columnar epithelium consists of elongated cells.

   Any epithelium can be simple or stratified. Simple epithelium has only a single cell layer.
   Stratified epithelium has more than one layer of cells. Pseudostratified epithelium is a single
   layer of cells so shaped that they appear at first glance to form two layers.

    Figure 2. Cuboidal epithelium. The image is cropped from Loyola University's LUMEN site at
    http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl1-04.jpg. Note the single layer of
    simple cuboidal epithelium lining either side of a tubule.

                                        [simplcolumnepith.gif]

   Functions of epithelial cells include:
     * movement materials in, out, or around the body.
     * protection of the internal environment against the external environment.
     * Secretion of a product.

   Glands can be single epithelial cells, such as the goblet cells that line the intestine.
   Multicellular glands include the endocrine glands. Many animals have their skin composed of
   epithelium. Vertebrates have keratin in their skin cells to reduce water loss. Many other
   animals secrete mucus or other materials from their skin, such as earthworms do.

         Figure 5. Glandular epithelium. The image is from Loyola University's LUMEN site at
         http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl1-24.jpg).

  Connective Tissue | Back to Top

   Connective tissue serves many purposes in the body:
     * binding
     * supporting
     * protecting
     * forming blood
     * storing fats
     * filling space

   Connective cells are separated from one another by a non-cellular matrix. The matrix may be
   solid (as in bone), soft (as in loose connective tissue), or liquid (as in blood). Two types of
   connective tissue are Loose Connective Tissue (LCT) and Fibrous Connective Tissue (FCT).
   Fibroblasts (LCT) are separated by a collagen fiber-containing matrix. Collagen fibers provide
   elasticity and flexibility. LCT occurs beneath epithelium in skin and many internal organs, such
   as lungs, arteries and the urinary bladder. This tissue type also forms a protective layer over
   muscle, nerves, and blood vessels.

   Figure 6. Adipose tissue, a type of connective tissue. The image is cropped from Loyola
   University's LUMEN page at http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl2-11.jpg.

                                            [adipose.gif]

   Adipose tissue, shown in Figure 6, has enlarged fibroblasts storing fats and reduced
   intracellular matrix. Adipose tissue facilitates energy storage and insulation.

   Fibrous Connective Tissue has many fibers of collagen closely packed together. FCT occurs in
   tendons, which connect muscle to bone. Ligaments are also composed of FCT and connect bone to
   bone at a joint.

   Cartilage and bone are "rigid" connective tissues. Cartilage, shown in Figure 7, has structural
   proteins deposited in the matrix between cells. Cartilage is the softer of the two "rigid"
   connective tissues. Cartilage forms the embryonic skeleton of vertebrates and the adult skeleton
   of sharks and rays. It also occurs in the human body in the ears, tip of the nose, and at joints
   such as the knee and between bones of the spinal column.

   University's LUMEN page at http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl4A-36.jpg.

                                            [elascart.gif]

   Bone, shown in Figure 8, has calcium salts in the matrix, giving it greater rigidity and
   strength. Bone also serves as a reservoir (or sink) for calcium. Protein fibers provide
   elasticity while minerals provide elasticity. Two types of bone occur. Dense bone has osteocytes
   (bone cells) located in lacunae connected by canaliculi. Lacunae are commonly referred to as
   Haversian canals. Spongy bone occurs at the ends of bones and has bony bars and plates separated
   by irregular spaces. The solid portions of spongy bone pick up stress.

   http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl4A-40.jpg. Note the haversian canal
   and surrounded by osteocytes and a mineralized matrix. The second image shows the structure and
   vascularization of bone. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by

   Blood is a connective tissue of cells separated by a liquid (plasma) matrix. Illustrations of
   blood cells are shown in Figure 9. Two types of cells occur. Red blood cells (erythrocytes)
   carry oxygen. White blood cells (leukocytes) function in the immune system. Plasma transports
   dissolved glucose, wastes, carbon dioxide and hormones, as well as regulating the water balance
   for the blood cells. Platelets are cell fragments that function in blood clotting.

  Muscle Tissue | Back to Top

   Muscle tissue facilitates movement of the animal by contraction of individual muscle cells
   (referred to as muscle fibers). Three types of muscle fibers occur in animals (the only
   taxonomic kingdom to have muscle cells):
     * skeletal (striated)
     * smooth
     * cardiac

   Muscle tissue and organization is shown in Figure 10.

   Figure 10. Organization of muscle tissue. Images from Purves et al., Life: The Science of
   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                            [muscle1.gif]

   [muscle2.gif]

   Muscle fibers are multinucleated, with the nuclei located just under the plasma membrane. Most
   of the cell is occupied by striated, thread-like myofibrils. Within each myofibril there are
   dense Z lines. A sarcomere (or muscle functional unit) extends from Z line to Z line. Each
   sarcomere has thick and thin filaments. The thick filaments are made of myosin and occupy the
   center of each sarcomere. Thin filaments are made of actin and anchor to the Z line.

   Skeletal (striated) muscle fibers, shown in Figure 11, have alternating bands perpendicular to
   the long axis of the cell. These cells function in conjunction with the skeletal system for
   voluntary muscle movements. The bands are areas of actin and myosin deposition in the cells.

   Figure 11. Striated muscle cells. The left image of striated muscle fibers is cropped from
   Loyola University's LUMEN site at
   http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl3A-45.jpg. The right image is from
   http://130.102.208.100/FMRes/FMPro?-db=images.fp3&key=32948&-img.

   [striatmusc.gif]

                   [semstriatedmuscle.gif]

   Smooth muscle fibers, shown in Figure 12, lack the banding, although actin and myosin still
   occur. These cells function in involuntary movements and/or autonomic responses (such as
   breathing, secretion, ejaculation, birth, and certain reflexes). Smooth muscle fibers are
   spindle shaped cells that form masses. These fibers are components of structures in the
   digestive system, reproductive tract, and blood vessels.

   Figure 12. Smooth muscle cells. The image of smooth muscle cells is cropped from Loyola
   University's LUMEN site at http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl3A-42.jpg.

                                           [smoothmusc.gif]

   Cardiac muscle fibers are a type of striated muscle found only in the heart. The cell has a
   bifurcated (or forked) shape, usually with the nucleus near the center of the cell. The cells
   are usually connected to each other by intercalated disks, as shown in Figure 13.

   Figure 13. Cardiac muscle cells. The top image of cardiac muscle cells is cropped from Loyola
   University's LUMEN site at http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Histo/HistoImages/hl3A-48.jpg.
   Note the dark band of the intercalated disk that separates two muscle cells. The bottom image is

  Nervous Tissue | Back to Top

   Nervous tissue, shown in Figure 14, functions in the integration of stimulus and control of
   response to that stimulus. Nerve cells are called neurons. Each neuron has a cell body, an axon,
   and many dendrites. Nervous tissue is composed of two main cell types: neurons and glial cells.
   Neurons transmit nerve messages. Glial cells are in direct contact with neurons and often
   surround them.

   4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used

                                           [neurons_1.gif]

   The neuron is the functional unit of the nervous system. Humans have about 100 billion neurons
   in their brain alone! While variable in size and shape, all neurons have three parts. Dendrites
   receive information from another cell and transmit the message to the cell body. The cell body
   contains the nucleus, mitochondria and other organelles typical of eukaryotic cells. The axon
   conducts messages away from the cell body. Neurons are shown in Figure 15.
