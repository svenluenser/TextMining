   The Paleozoic Era literally translates as the "time of ancient life" and spans the time period
   between 544 and 245 million years ago. The Paleozoic is the first of three eras within the
   Phanerozoic Eon (the time of visible life). While life originated during the Archean and
   increased in complexity during the earlier Proterozoic, the Paleozoic Era is marked by the
   spread of animals with hard preservable parts such as shells and exoskeletons. This has led to
   what is popularly known as the Cambrian Explosion, the sudden appearance of a stupendous array
   of animal life, much of which is not closely related to modern forms. Despite extinctions at
   various times, the Paleozoic is notable for the increasing modernization of life. By the end of
   the Paleozoic, almost all major groups of life had developed. The Paleozoic ended in the
   greatest mass extinction event in world history. During this massive die-off nearly 96% of all
   marine species went extinct. The cause of this greatest catastrophe in Earth history has been
   much investigated and scientific consensus of its cause is emerging.

   During the Paleozoic we see several major advances in life. The aformentioned Cambrian Explosion
   is the first. The evolution of plants from some group of green algae during the Ordovician is
   another, since these plants moved from water onto land, paving the way for vertebrate animals to
   follow. The first vertebrates, amphibians, were little more than legged fish, although their
   remote descendants would come to rule the land as reptiles, the first truly terrestrial
   vertebrates.

   Geologically, the Paleozoic is noted for the assembly of Pangaea, the world supercontinent
   proposed back in the 1912 book The Origin of Continents and Oceans by German meteorologist
   Alfred Wegener (1880-1930) as part of his continental drift hypothesis. At the close of the
   precambrian there was already a world supercontinent, Rodinia, that broke apart during the early
   Paleozoic.

  The Cambrian Explosion | Back to Top

   The Cambrian period, the first in the Paleozoic era, spans the time between 544 and 505 million
   years ago. During what is termed the Cambrian Explosion, living thiungs developed hard
   structures. The presence of these structures greatly enhanced the chance of an organism becoming
   a fossil. Prior to the Cambrian, fossils were quite rare and inconspicuous since the organisms
   were small. This scarcity of the precambrian fossil record is also a consequence of the
   soft-bodied forms of life needing exceptionally rare circumstances to form fossils.

   The sudden appearance of relatively complex fossils in the Cambrian was a troubling issue to
   Charles Darwin. His ideas on evolution included descent with modification and the slow, gradual
   development of more complex creatures from simpler ones. The lack of a precambrian fossil record
   was compounded by the wild diversity seen during the Cambrian. Darwin's dilemma would not be
   solved until the 1960s when scientists got a better handle on the actual diversity of the
   precambrian biosphere.

   The early Cambrian was a wild time for animal evolution. During a span of time perhaps as short
   as 5 million years numerous body plans developed, including the three animal body plans that
   exist today. All major animal phyla, save the Bryozoans, have their first appearance during the
   Cambrian. One of the dominant animal groups that appeared was the trilobites. These now-extinct
   members of the Phylum Arthroopoda became the dominant animals in many Cambrian marine
   environments. Another major change was the evolution and spread of the archaeocyathids, a group
   of sponges (Phylum Porifiera) that became extinct before the end of the Cambrian. Cladistic
   analysis by J. Reitner in 1990 suggests archaeocyathids are properly placed in the Phylum
   Porifera instead of having their own phylum. Before their extinction, however, they were
   important reef-building organisms, along with some calcareous algae. Some scientists speculate
   that archaeocyathids existed symbiotically with cyanobacteria, much the was modern coral do with
   zooxanthellae (symbiotic dinoflagellates). Paleontologists recognize an amazing 120 taxonomic
   families of archaeocyathids during the early Cambrian. From this great diversity the group
   declined to extinction by the close of the Cambrian.

   The Burgess Shale Fauna

   This deposit of rare and exquisitely preserved fossils has been much touted in numerous
   publications. The deposit was discovered by geologist Charles D. Walcott, who stopped to look at
   his horse's hoof and spotted an odd fossil by the trail. Walcott returned the next field season
   (and four others) and excavated over 50,000 fossils, which he later formally named and described
   in scientific publications. Modern studies suggest the presence of approximately 125 different
   genera from the Burgess Shale, amking it the most complete and famous known Paleozoic
   assemblage. The organisms range from the prokaryotic cyanobacteria to eukaryotic green and red
   algae, to sponges, brachiopods, priapulids, annelids, and many different arthropod groups, as
   well as echinoderms and possibly one of the first chordates.

   One of the most common Burgess animals is ther arthropod Marella. These animals were small, and
   exhibited the jointed appendages characterizing the arthropods. These delicat looking arthropods
   are referred to as "lace crabs". The quality of preservation of these fossils is quite
   extraordinary. On many specimens dark stains are interpreted as body fluids that have leaked
   from the specimen after burial.

   Trilobites, a dominant Cambrian animal, lso occur in the Burgess Shale in abundance. Trilobites
   are an extinct group of arthropods that were most dominant in the Cambrain before finally
   becoming extinct at the close of the Paleozoic. Like Marella and other arthropods, trilobites
   have a hard exoskeleton (that enhanced the chances of fossilization) and numerous jointed
   appendages. In the trilobite shown, details of the appendages are not clear.

   The Burgess deposits also yielded the oldest representative of the phylum Chordata, a small
   fossil known as Pikaia. Most specimens of Pikaia are between one and one and a half inches long.
   Chordates, the phylum to which humans belong, has three distinguishing characteristics, all of
   which are present in Pikaia. The extant animal known as a lancet bears at least a superficial
   resemblance to Pikaia.

   While many of the Burgess animals can be ascribed to modern groups, a startling number of them
   do not belong in such a group. Opabinia shows a segment body, but has five eyes and a feeding
   appendage. No living animal is similar.

   Among the animals of uncertain taxonomic affinity that characterize the Burgess fauna,
   Anomalocaris must rank as surely the biggest and baddest of the lot. Ranging up to about one
   half meter in length, this animal was the largest predator to range the Cambrian seas. Trilobite
   fossils have been recovered with what appears to be bite marks from the complex mouth structures
   of Anomalocaris. Usually Anomalocaris is found dissassociated, in fact the mouth parts, feeding
   appendages, and body were all described under different genus names. Rare fossils that show the
   articulation of these body parts have allowed scientists to reconstruct this animal.

  The Cambrian World

   The world supercontinent, Rodinia, that had existed at the close of the Proterozoic began to
   split apart due to rifting of various landmasses away from the whole. One such landmass was what
   eventually became North America. During the Cambrian North America moved northward toward the
   equator. The largest remaining landmass of Rodinia was Gondwana, composed of the present-day
   contnents of India, Australia, Antarctica, Africa, and South America. The lands that today form
   Europe were scattered and fragmented, for the most part in the southern hemisphere. The lack of
   landmass at either pole suggests relatively mild temperatures and an absence of glaciation, at
   least early in the Cambrian. Shallow seas flooded the edges of continents, creating many broad
   environments for marine animals and other organisms.

  The Cambrian Extinctions

   The Cambrian period is marked by as many as four mass extinctions. The first of these mass
   extinctions resulted in the disappearance of the archaeocyathids and a major group of
   trilobites. The later extinctions limited the diversity of conodonts, brachiopods, and other
   triolobite groups. The Cambrian is bracketed by large scale glaciation at the close of the
   Proterozoic and by a similar occurrence early in the Ordovician. Development of continental
   glaciers would have several consequences: cooling of the planet and a drop in sea level. Both of
   these might have happened quickly enough for a mass extinction to have resulted.

  The Ordovician | Back to Top

   The Ordovician period representes the period of geologic time between 505 to 440 million years
   ago. Following the extinctions at the close of the Cambrian period, diversification occurred
   among the survivors. Corals become dominant reef-building animals during the Ordovician, and
   continue their importance today.  Bryozoans and algae were also dominant elements of the reef
   building biota. Trilobites, which had survived the end of the Cambrian, continued, but were not
   as dominant in the environment as they had been. The Ordovician is noteworthy because of the
   moves some green algae made toward the shoreline, and possibly onto land, becoming the first
   plants. Interesting animals of the period include the conodonts (thought to represent early
   vertebrates) and graptolites. The first fish also evolved.

   Bryozoans are a group of organisms sometimes referred to as "moss animals". They form colonies,
   often consisting of millions of individuals. There are nearly 5000 living species and a great
   many more taxa known from the fossil record. Among invertebrate animal phyla, this is the only
   phylum that does not have representatives appearing during the Cambrian.

                                            [bryozoa.jpg]

   Brachiopods were present (although not major organisms in the environments) during the Cambrian,
   but after the Cambrian extinction, they underwent an adaptive radiation in the Ordovician.
   Brachiopods have bilaterally symmetrical shells, which make them among the most common marine
   fossils in Paleozoic rocks. Traditionally brachiopods were divided into articulate and
   inaticulate groups, depending on the presence or absence (respectively) of a hinge between the
   halves of the shell. The earliest brachiopods were inarticulated, and lacked that hinge. Lingula
   is an example of this type, with fossils very similar to that genus being found in Cambrian
   rocks, and persisting even today. Systematics of the brachiopods has been under intense revision
   lately, and the traditional split of the two groups may not in fact be a natural characteristic
   useful in taxonomy.

   Graptolites are an enigmatic fossil group that has considerable use in the correlation of
   Paleozoic rocks. These organisms are related to the extant phylum Hemichordata. Graptolites are
   thought to have floated in the water column above the seafloor, although a few are thought to
   have lived on the seabed. .

   Conodonts are another group of "odd fossils". At one time considered to be mouthparts of annelid
   worms, conodonts are now known to have been part of the "teeth" of an early vertebrate fish.

   The phylum Mollusca increased in significance in the Ordovician faunas. Where the Cambrian seas
   had Anomalocaris as the largest free swimming predator, the Ordovician had swimming molluscs, a
   type known as a cephalopod. Nautiloids resemble, somewhat, their living distant relatives the
   chambered nautilus and squids.

   Gastropods, another class of the phylum Mollusca, also become more prevalent in the Ordovician
   seas. Ordovician deposits yield snails, as well as large, sedentary gastropods such as
   Maclurites.

   Perhaps the most pround advance during the Ordovician was the development of plants from an
   ancestral group of green algae. Fossil and biochemical evidence indicates plants are descended
   from multicellular green algae. Various green algal groups have been proposed for this ancestral
   type, with the Charophytes often being prominently mentioned. Cladistic studies support the
   inclusion of the Charophytes (including the Coleochaetales) as sister taxa to the land plants.
   Algae dominated the oceans of the precambrian time over 700 million years ago. Between 500 and
   400 million years ago, some algae made the transition to land, becoming plants by developing a
   series of adaptations to help them survive out of the water.

   The Ordovician plant record consists solely of spored with a trilete mark, a y-shaped feature
   formed when the spores were formed by (presumably) meiosis. One possible interpretation of the
   presence of spores is that the land plant (trilete) spore have evolved prior to the move of
   plant ancestral types onto land.

   The vertebrates evolved during the Cambrian period, possibly from a creature similar to the
   Burgess Shale animal Pikaia or an organism similar to the "conodont" animal. The oldest group of
   fish, the ostracodemrs, first appeared during the Cambrian, before their extinction at the close
   of the devonian. The Ordovician. was a time of great transgression of the seas onto the
   continents, producing a great many habitats in which new forms of life, such as fish, could
   develop. The exact appearance of the Ordovician fish in unclear. What we do have is fragments of
   hard coverings of soft tissue.

  The Ordovician World

   The Ordovician was a time of flooding of the continents with shallow seas. Organic reefs were
   abundant in middle to tropical paleolatitudes. By the end of th Ordovician most of the
   landmasses were close to or joined to Gondwana, which at bthat time was centered around the
   south pole. The late Ordovician also saw the spread of major glaciers in Gondwana, and the
   environmental conseqwuences that accompany that spread: sea-level falling, changes in oceanic
   circulation, cooling of the climate and restriction of the tropical belts. North America at this
   time was still astride the equator.

  The Ordovician Mass Extinction

   The end of the Ordovicianperiod saw another mass extinction, accounting for the second most
   severe loss of marine species during the Phanerozoic. This mass extinction saw the loss of one
   third of all brachiopod and bryozoans, and the loss of groups of conodonts, trilobites, and
   graptolites. The falling sea-levels caused by the growth of the continental glaciers caused much
   of the reef-building fauna to become either locally or globally extinct. Over one hundred
   families of marine invertebrates disappeared. However, this loss paved the way for an adaptive
   radiation during the next period, the Silurian.

  The Silurian | Back to Top

   The Silurian period (440 to 410 million years ago) saw a return to the moderate climates that
   had existed before the Cambrian and Ordovician glaciations. Eukaryotic life colonized
   terrestrial environments. Fish underwent an adaptive radiation with the jawed fish appearing and
   spreading into freshwater.

   Corals, which had appeared possibly as early as the late Proterozoic, diversified into a number
   of groups during the Silurian. Tabulate corals and rugose corals were major components of the
   new, larger reefs built during the Silurian through Permian. Rugose corals included the horn
   corals, while tabulate corals were colonial. Both the rugose and tabulate corals went extinct at
   the close of the Permian period.

   Crinoids, a group of organisms in the phylym Echinodermata, had been present since the
   Ordovician (and possibly the Cambrian). With the flooding of continents during the Silurian,
   crinoids underwent an adaptive radiation and produced a number of interesting forms. The
   croinoid fossil can consist of three body parts, usually separated by sedimentological processes
   after the organism died: the basal holdfast, stalk, and head. Crinoid stems were so common in
   some areas of the U.S. midwest that native peoples used them as a form of currency. Crinoids
   were significant elements of the marine fauna until they nearly went extinct (down to a single
   genus) at the close of the Permian period.

   specimen of Caryocrinites ornatus (R) shows details of the stalk and head region. Images from

   Stromatoporoids, once thought to be coral, but actually sponges, continued their significant
   role in Silurian reefs. Some stromatoporoid specimens are over 16 feet in diameter.
   Stromatoporoids finally went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous extinction.

   One arthropod group became more diverse during the Silurian and Devonian times, the eurypterids,
   or sea scorpions. The oldest fossil eurypterids are from the Ordovician, but the group increased
   in species number and size during the Silurian-Devonian before its eventual extinction at the
   close of the Permian. Eurypterids were chelicerates, the group of arthropods that includes the
   spiders and scorpions. Eurypterids were among the major swimming predators of the
   Silurian-Devonian seas. Eurypterids are so common in the Silurian rocks of New York that they
   are the state fossil.

   Fish continued to divesify, with the oldest jawed fish, the placoderms, joining the ostracoderms
   and acanthodian fish. The great explosion of these fish groups would occur during the Devonian
   period. During the Silurian, however, fish established themselves in both marine and freshwater
   environments.

   Perhaps the most significant advance of life during the Silurian was the colonization of the
   land, first by plants and insects, and later (during the devonian) by certain "fish" and their
   offshoots, the amphibians. The Silurian land was populated by early land plants as well as a
   variety of insects. Both plants and animals had a number of challenges when they moved from the
   water to land.
    1. Drying out. Once removed from water and exposed to air, organisms must deal with the need to
       conserve water. A number of approaches have developed, such as the development of waterproof
       skin (in animals), living in very moist environments (amphibians, bryophytes), and
       production of a waterproof surface (the cuticle in plants, cork layers and bark in woody
       trees).
    2. Gas exchange. Organisms that live in water are often able to exchange carbon dioxide and
       oxygen gases through their surfaces. These exchange surfaces are moist, thin layers across
       which diffusion can occur. Organismal response to the challenge of drying out tends to make
       these surfaces thicker, waterproof, and to retard gas exchange. Consequently, another method
       of gas exchange must be modified or developed. Many fish already had gills and swim
       bladders, so when some of them began moving between ponds, the swim bladder (a gas retention
       structure helping buoyancy in the fish) began to act as a gas exchange surface, ultimately
       evolving into the terrestrial lung. Many arthropods had gills or other internal respiratory
       surfaces that were modified to facilitate gas exchange on land. Plants are thought to share
       common ancestry with algae. The plant solution to gas exchange is a new structure, the guard
       cells that flank openings (stomata) in the above ground parts of the plant. By opening these
       guard cells the plant is able to allow gas exchange by diffusion through the open stomata.
    3. Support. Organisms living in water are supported by the dense liquid they live in. Once on
       land, the organisms had to deal with the less dense air, which could not support their
       weight. Adaptations to this include animal skeletons and specialized plant cells/tissues
       that support the plant.
    4. Conduction. Single celled organisms only have tyo move materials in, out, and within their
       cells. A multicellular creature must do this at each cell in the body, plus move material
       in, out, and within the organism. Adaptations to this include the circulatory systems of
       animals, and the specialized conducting tissues xylem and phloem in plants. Some
       multicellular algae and bryophytes also have specialized conducting cells.
    5. Reproduction. Organisms in water can release their gametes into the water, where the gametes
       will swim by flagella until they ecounter each other and fertilization happens. On land,
       such a scenario is not possible. Land animals have had to develop specialized reproductive
       systems involving fertilization when they return to water (amphibians), or internal
       fertilization and an amniotic egg (reptiles, birds, and mammals). Insects developed similar
       mechanisms. Plants have also had to deal with this, either by living in moist environments
       like the ferns and bryophytes do, or by developing specialized delivery systems like pollen
       tubes to get the sperm cells to the egg.

   Plants divide into two large groups: vascular plants that contain lignified conducting cells,
   and the nonvascular plants, which do not. Some Silurian plant fossils might be algae or
   nonvascular plants. Vascular plants developed during the Silurian period, 400 million years ago.
   The earliest vascular plants had no roots, leaves, fruits, or flowers.

   Cooksonia is a typical early vascular plant. It was less than 15 cm tall, with stems that
   dichotomously branched. Dichotomous branching (where the stem divides into two ewqual branches)
   appears a primitive or ancestral trait in vascular plants. Some branches terminated in sporangia
   that produced a single size of spore.

   Many scientists now consider "Cooksonia" an evolutionary grade rather than a true monophyletic
   taxon. Their main argument is that not all stems of Cooksonia-type plants have vascular tissue.
   The evolutionary situation of a grade would have some members of the group having the trait,
   others not. The shapes of sporangia on various specimens of Cooksonia also vary considerably.

   Many of the early land plant fossils are not unequivocally those of vascular plants. The best
   such evidence is the presence of a trilete mark on spores produced by meiosis in a tetrahedral
   tetrad.

   Baragwanathia is an undoubted lycophyte from the middle Silurian deposits of Australia. It has
   microphyllous leaves spirally attached to the stem, and sporangia clustered in some areas of the
   plant, although not in terminal strobili. Many paleobotanists consider Baragwanathia ancestral
   to the modern lycophytes and later lepidodendrids of the carboniferous forests.

   Baragwanathia longifolia, an Australian lycopod from Yea, Victoria and other localities. This
   plant has been controversial for some time because of its potential age as upper Silurian,
   predating or corresponding in age with much more primitive Cooksonia-like vascular plants. In
   the photograph above you can see the relatively stout axis thickly clothed by numerous
   helically-arranged microphylls. Scale is in mm. Image from

  The Silurian World

   Silurian climates were characterized by a warming and return to moderate temperatures following
   the terminal Ordovician glaciation (and the resulting mass extinction). North America remained
   near the equator, but began to join with Baltical to the east and Siberia to the north. Gondwana
   remained as a large southern hemisphere landmass, although there is no evidence of glaciation
   there during the Silurian. The collision of Baltica and North America caused mountain building
   (what geologists refer to as the Caledonian orogeny) along with the closing of the ancient
   Iapetus ocean. Between Baltica and Gondwana, however, a new ocean, Tethys, began to form. The
   end of the Silurian is not marked by a major mass extinction event.

Learning Objectives | Back to Top

     * What were the major forms of animal life that developed durimng the Cambrian explosion and
       what advantages or new ways of life did they represent?
     * How did the cambrian faunas differ from the Vendian (late Proterozoic) assemblages.
     * What might account for the increased fossil record of the Cambrian and later times?
     * The extinction of organisms at the close of one geologic period is said to "pave the way"
       for an adaptive radiation of life in a succeeding period. Explain how the disappearance of
       organisms might allow for such diversification among the survivors.
