  Populations | Back to Top

   Without variation (which arises from mutations of DNA molecules to produce new alleles) natural
   selection would have nothing on which to act. A population is a group of individuals living in
   the same geographical area and sharing a common gene pool. The gene pool is the sum of all
   genetic information carried by the members of a population.

   All genetic variation in a population is generated by mutation. Mutation is any heritable change
   in DNA. Mutations can be changes of a single nucleotide base or may involve changes in
   chromosome number. Whether a mutation is good, neutral, or harmful depends on how it affects
   survival and reproductive success.

  Population Genetics | Back to Top

   A population is a group of potentially interbreeding organisms of the same species occupying a
   certain area. Members of a population vary from one another. This variation is the raw material
   on which natural selection operates.

   There are several types of mutations, both at the gene-level and the chromosome-level. Gene
   mutations provide new alleles, making these mutations the ultimate source of variation. A gene
   mutation is an alteration in the DNA nucleotide sequence, producing an alternate sequence,
   termed an allele. Mutations occur at random, and can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Some
   chromosomal mutations are changes in the number of chromosomes inherited, while others are
   alterations in arrangement of alleles on chromosomes due to inversions and translocations.

   In sexually reproducing organisms, genetic recombination is the realloc ation of alleles and
   chromosomes. Recombination results from crossing-over during meiosis, the random segregation of
   chromosomes to gametes during meiotic division, and the random combination of gametes during
   fertilization. The entire genotype is subject to natural selection since new combinations of
   alleles may have improve the reproductive success of the organism. For polygenic traits, the
   most favorable combination may occur when the right alleles group by recombination.

   Not only are variations created, they are also preserved and passed on from one generation to
   the next.The gene pool is the total of all the alleles in a population, in the context of gene
   frequencies. Neither dominance nor sexual reproduction will change allele frequencies.

    The Hardy-Weinberg Law

   This law states an equilibrium of allele frequencies in a gene pool (using a formula p^2 + 2pq +
   q^2) remains in effect in each succeeding generation of a sexually reproducing population if
   five conditions are met.
    1. No mutation: no allelic changes occur.
    2. No gene flow: migration of alleles into or out of the population does not occur.
    3. Random mating: individuals pair by chance and not according to their genotypes or
       phenotypes.
    4. No genetic drift: the population is large so changes in allele frequencies due to chance are
       insignificant.
    5. No selection: no selective force favors one genotype over another.

   These conditions of the Hardy-Weinberg law are rarely met, so allele frequencies in the gene
   pool of a population do change from one generation to the next, resulting in evolution. We can
   now consider that any change of allele frequencies in a gene pool indicates that evolution has
   occurred. The Hardy-Weinberg law proposes those factors that violate the conditions listed cause
   evolution. A Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium provides a baseline by which to judge whether evolution
   has occurred. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a constancy of gene pool frequencies that remains
   across generations, and might best be found among stable populations with no natural selection
   or where selection is stabilizing. Microevolution is the accumulation of small changes in a gene
   pool over a relatively short period.

  Mutation Rate | Back to Top

   Gene mutations result in new alleles, and are the source of variation within populations. Gene
   mutations are ultimately behind the other mechanisms that provide variation. Due to DNA
   replication and DNA repair mechanisms, mutation rates of individual genes are low, but since
   each organism has many genes, and a population has many individuals, new mutations arise in
   populations all the time. Thus, mutations are relatively common, and the mutation rate is an
   adequate source of new alleles. High levels of molecular variation are common in natural
   populations, although many mutations (usually recessive) are hidden.

   The mutation rate varies greatly among species and even among genes of an individual. Mutations
   are caused by errors in DNA replication, chemicals, or radiation. Large scale effects of
   mutation result only when mutation is combined with other factors that reshuffle the gene pool.

   Selection acts on individuals, not their individual genes. Sexual reproduction increases
   variation by reshuffling the genetic information from parents into new combinations in their
   offspring. Mutations produce new alleles.

  Additional Sources of Variation | Back to Top

   Gene flow moves alleles among populations through interbreeding as well as by migration of
   breeding individuals. Gene flow increases variation within a population by introducing new
   alleles produced in another population. Continued gene flow tends to decrease the diversity
   among populations, causing gene pools to become similar. Reduction or restriction of gene flow
   between populations is essential for the development of new species.

   The frequency of alleles can change from generation to generation as a result of chance alone in
   a small gene pool. This phenomenon is known as genetic drift.

   Random mating involves individuals pairing by chance, not according to their genotypes or
   phenotypes. Nonrandom mating involves individuals inbreeding and assortative mating. Inbreeding
   is mating between relatives to a greater extent than by chance; inbreeding can occur if
   dispersal is so low that mates are likely to be related and does not change allele frequencies,
   but it does decrease the proportion of heterozygotes and increase the proportions of both
   homozygotes at all gene loci.

   Assortative mating occurs when individuals tend to mate with those that have the same phenotype.
   Assortative mating divides a population into two phenotypic classes with reduced gene exchange.

   Genetic drift is changes in allele frequencies of a gene pool due to chance or random events.
   This can occur in large or small populations. Genetic drift causes gene pools of two isolated
   populations to become dissimilar as some alleles are lost and other are fixed.

   Genetic drift occurs when founders (or colonizers) establish a new population, or after a
   genetic bottleneck and resultant interbreeding. The founder effect is a case of genetic drift in
   which rare alleles, or combinations of alleles, occur in higher frequency in a population
   isolated from the general population. Founding individuals contain a fraction of the total
   genetic diversity of original gene pool. The alleles carried by founders is determined by chance
   alone. Consider the Pilgrim colonists in New England. By no means did they represent all the
   genetic variation of the human species or even genetic variations among Europeans.

   When a population is started by one or a few individuals who randomly separate from a larger
   population, chance may dictate that allele frequencies in the new population may be very
   different from those of the original population. Many species on islands (such as the famous
   Darwin's finches on the Gal치pagos) display founder effects. The Gal치pagos Islands are volcanic
   islands off the coast of South America. They had fewer types of organisms than the South
   American mainland. The island species varied from the mainland species, and from
   island-to-island. Each island had a variation of tortoise that correlated with different
   vegetation and environmental conditions on that island.

   Finches on the Gal치pagos Islands resembled a mainland finch but there were more types. Gal치pagos
   finch species varied by nesting site, beak size, and eating habits. One unusual finch used a
   twig or thorn to pry out insects, a job normally done by a woodpecker. The finches posed
   questions to Darwin: did they descend from one mainland ancestor, did islands allow isolated
   populations to evolve independently, and could present-day species have resulted from changes
   occurring in each isolated population.

   Drastic short-term reductions of population size caused by natural disasters, disease, or
   predators may result in (by chance) the survivors representing only a small portion of the
   original gene pool. Even when the population increases to its original size, a portion of its
   original genetic diversity remains lost. This feature, termed a bottleneck, is a problem with
   many endangered species.

   A bottleneck effect is genetic drift in which a severe reduction in population size results from
   natural disaster, predation, or habitat reduction. This results in a severe reduction of the
   total genetic diversity of the original gene pool. The cheetah bottleneck causes relative
   infertility because of the intense inbreeding. Similarly, the Hawaiian silversword has passed
   recently through its pwn bottleneck. Recent studies on humans suggest that there may have been
   one or more instances of severe genetic bottlenecks in our own prehistory. The bottleneck effect
   prevents most genotypes from participating in production of next generation.

   Migration into or out of a population can breakdown genetic differences between populations.
   Mutations developing in one population may be spread to other populations by migration. This
   serves, like mutation, to introduce new alleles into populations.

  Natural Selection | Back to Top

   Not all members of a population necessarily have an equal chance of surviving and reproducing
   (due to competition for resources and mates). By virtue of small phenotypic variations, some
   individuals are better adapted to their environment than are others. The better adapted
   individuals are more "fit" and tend to survive and reproduce, passing on their adaptations to
   the next generation in greater frequency than those adaptations of the less "fit" members of the
   population.

   Fitness is a measure of an individuals ability to survive and reproduce. Those with the highest
   fitness are more likely to survive and reproduce. Thus, they make a greater contribution to the
   gene pool, of the next generation than do those less "fit".

   Natural selection is the process of differential survival and reproduction that inevitably leads
   to changes in allele frequencies over time as those individuals who are the most "fit" survive
   and leave more offspring. There are three patterns, or types, of natural selection.

    Stabilizing Selection

   Stabilizing selection favors the intermediate phenotype out of a range of phenotypes. The
   extremes in variation are selected against. Infants weighing significantly less or more than 7.5
   pounds have higher rates of infant mortality. Selection works against both extremes.

                                           [stabsel_1.gif]

   Living fossils, like the coelacanth, ginkgo, and horseshoe crab, are examples of organisms that
   are relatively unchanged from their distant ancestors.

    Directional Selection

   Directional selection tends to favor phenotypes at one extreme of the range of variation.
   Insecticide resistance is an example. DDT was a widely used insecticide. After a few years of
   extensive use, DDT lost its effectiveness on insects. Resistance to DDT is a genetic trait that
   the presence of DDT in the environment made into a favored trait. Only those insects resistant
   to DDT survived, leading over time to populations largely resistant to DDT.

                                          [directselect.gif]

   Another example is the peppered moth (Biston betularia). Before the Industrial Revolution in the
   18th and early 19th centuries, only light-colored moths were collected in light-colored
   woodlands in England. There was a rare, dark form. With the pollution caused by the buring of
   coal, the light-colored tree trunks became darker due to soot. The once rare dark-colored moths
   became more prevalent, while the once-common light-colored moths became increasingly rare.
   Reason: predation by birds. The color that had the greatest contrast with the background (tree
   trunk) was at a disadvantage. Cleanup of the forest during the 1950s caused the allele
   frequencies of light and dark moths to reverse to pre-Industrial Revolution levels, dark moths
   are now rare, light moths are now common.

   The resistance of many bacterial species to antibiotics ia another example of directional
   selection. Over 200 speciews show some degree of antibiotic resistance, necessitating the
   development and more prudent use of a new generation of antibiotic medicines.

    Disruptive Selection

   Disruptive selection favors individuals at both extremes of variation: selection is against the
   middle of the curve. This causes a discontinuity of the variations, causing two or more morphs
   or distinct phenotypes. The African swallowtail butterfly (Papilo dardanus) produces two
   distinct morphs, both of which resemble brightly colored but distasteful butterflies of other
   species. Each morph gains protection from predation although it is in fact quite edible.

  Speciation | Back to Top

   As populations diverge, they form similar but related species. When are two populations new
   species? When populations no longer interbreed they are thought to be separate species. As
   natural selection adapts populations occupying different environments, they will diverge into
   races, subspecies, and finally separate species.

   A species can be defined as one or more populations of interbreeding organisms that are
   reproductively isolated in nature from all other organisms. Genetic divergence results when
   adaptation, drift and mutation act on populations. Barriers to gene flow between populations
   isolate those populations, ultimately leading to the formation of new and separate species.

    Allopatric Speciation

   Populations begin to diverge when gene flow between them is restricted. Geographic isolation is
   often the first step in allopatric speciation. Other mechanisms may develop that further
   restrict reproduction between populations: these are the reproductive isolating mechanisms.

    Sympatric Speciation

   Sympatric speciation happens when members of a population develop some genetic difference that
   prevents them from reproducing with the parent type. This mechanism is best understood in
   plants, where failure to reduce chromosome number results in polyploid plants that reproduce
   successfully only with other polyploids. Reproduction with their parent population (the
   diploids) produces sterile offspring.

    Reproductive Isolating Mechanisms

   A reproductive isolating mechanism is a structural, functional, or behavioral characteristic
   that prevents successful reproduction from occurring. These mechanisms divide into premating and
   postmating types.

   Premating isolating mechanisms are anatomical or behavioral differences between two species that
   prevent the possibility of mating. Habitat isolation occurs when two species occupy different
   habitats, even within the same geographic range, so that they are less likely to meet and to
   attempt to reproduce. Temporal isolation occurs when two species live in the same location, but
   each reproduces at a different time of the year, preventing a successful mating. Behavioral
   isolation occurs when there are differences in mating behavior between two species. Mechanical
   isolation is the result of differences between two species in reproductive structures or other
   body parts, so that mating is prevented.

   Postmating isolating mechanisms are the result of developmental or physiological differences
   between the members of two species after mating. Gamete isolation is the physical or chemical
   incompatibility of gametes of two different species. If the gametes lack receptors to facilitate
   fusion, they cannot form a zygote. An egg may have receptors only for the sperm of its own
   species. Zygote mortality is a mechanism that works when hybrids (offspring of parents of two
   different species) do not live to reproduce. Hybrid sterility occurs when the hybrid offspring
   are sterile (e.g., mules).

    Polyploidy and Hybridization

                                [polyploidy_1.gif] [polyploidy_2.gif]

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   Polyploidy and hybridization are important speciation mechanisms in plants. Whereas animals tend
   to be unisexual, plants often have both sexes functional in the same individual. Consequently,
   plants can (if they lack a self-incompatability mechanism) reproduce with themselves (both
   sexually and asexually), establishing a reproductively isolated species very rapidly.

  The Pace of Evolution | Back to Top

   The pace of evolution is often slow, so slow that all of the stages in species formation cannot
   be observed. The traditional, or Darwinian, view of evolution was that it was a very slow
   process, resulting from the gradual accumulation of small differences. Recently, several
   alternative views on the pace and events in species formation have been proposed. These are
   collectively called quantum speciation.

    Punctuated Equilibrium

   According to another model based on the fossil record, speciation occurs rapidly over a short
   time, followed by a long period of little or no change. "Short" means thousands or hundreds of
   thousands of years. This differs greatly from Darwin's original view of slow and gradual change
   continuing over very long periods of time.

  Evidence for Evolution | Back to Top

   Evolution, which started out as a hypothesis, is now supported by evidence from many fields of
   science.

    Fossils: Evidence of Past Life

   The fossil record is the history of life recorded by remains from the past. Fossils include
   skeletons, shells, seeds, insects trapped in amber, dung, DNA and other chemicals, imprints of
   leaves, and tracks of organisms that lived in the distant past. Most fossils are at least 10,000
   years old.

   The fossil record traces history of life and allows us to study history of particular organisms.
   Fossil evidence supports the common descent hypothesis; fossils can be linked over time because
   they reveal a similarity in form, despite observed changes. Transitional forms reveal links
   between groups: Archaeopteryx is between reptiles and birds; Eustheopteron is an amphibious
   fish; Seymouria is a reptile-like amphibian; therapsids were mammal-like reptiles.

                                             [archie.gif]

   The fossil record allows us to trace the history of the modern-day horse Equus. The earliest
   fossils in this lineage is Hyracotherium , which was the size of a dog, with cusped low-crowned
   molars, four toes on each front foot, three on each hind foot--all adaptations for forest
   living. When forests were replaced by grasslands, the intermediates were selected for durable
   grinding teeth, speed, etc. with an increase in size and decrease in toes. Living organisms
   resemble most recent fossils in the line of descent; underlying similarities allow us to trace a
   line of descent over time.

    Biogeography: Separation and Divergence

   Biogeography is the study of the distribution of plants and animals throughout the world.
   Distribution of organisms is explained by related forms evolving in one locale and spreading to
   other accessible areas. Darwin observed South America had no rabbits; he concluded rabbits
   originated elsewhere. Biogeography explains why many finch species are on the Gal치pagos Islands
   but not mainland.

   Physical factors, such as the location of continents, determine where a population can spread.
   Cacti are restricted to North American deserts and euphorbia grow in African deserts. Marsupials
   arose when South America, Antarctica, and Australia were all joined; Australia separated before
   placental mammals arose, so only marsupials diversified in Australia.

    Comparative Anatomy: Similarities Due to Common Ancestry

   Organisms have anatomical similarities when they are closely related because of common descent,
   as substantiated by comparative anatomy. Homologous structures in different organisms are
   inherited from a common ancestor. Vertebrate forelimbs contain the same sets of bones organized
   in similar ways, despite their dissimilar functions.

   Vestigial structures are remains of a structure that was functional in some ancestor but is no
   longer functional in the organism in question. Most birds have well-developed wings, although
   some birds have reduced wings and do not fly. Humans have a tail bone (the coccyx) but no tail.
   The presence of vestigial structures is explained by the common descent hypothesis.

   Embryological development reveals a unity of plan. During development, all vertebrates have a
   notochord and paired pharyngeal pouches. In fishes and amphibian larvae, the pouches become
   gills. In humans, first pair of pouches becomes a cavity of middle ear and auditory tube; second
   pair becomes tonsils, while third and fourth pairs become thymus and parathyroid glands. This
   makes sense only if fish are ancestral to other vertebrate groups.

    Biochemistry: Differences and Similarities

   Almost all living organisms use the same basic biochemical molecules, including DNA, ATP, and
   many identical or nearly identical enzymes. Organisms utilize the same DNA triplet base code and
   the same 20 amino acids in their proteins. Many organisms share same introns and types of
   repeats, which is remarkable since we know of no obvious functional reason why these components
   need to be so similar. These similarities can be explained by descent from a common ancestor.
   This is substantiated by analysis of degree of similarity in amino acids for cytochrome c among
   organisms.
