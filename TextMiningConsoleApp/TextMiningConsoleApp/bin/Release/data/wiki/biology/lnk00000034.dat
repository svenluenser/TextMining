Laws of Thermodynamics | Back to Top

   Energy exists in many forms, such as heat, light, chemical energy, and electrical energy. Energy
   is the ability to bring about change or to do work. Thermodynamics is the study of energy.

   First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be
   created or destroyed. The total amount of energy and matter in the Universe remains constant,
   merely changing from one form to another. The First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation) states
   that energy is always conserved, it cannot be created or destroyed. In essence, energy can be
   converted from one form into another. Click here for another page (developed by Dr. John Pratte,
   Clayton State Univ., GA) covering thermodynamics.

   The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that "in all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or
   leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the
   initial state." This is also commonly referred to as entropy. A watchspring-driven watch will
   run until the potential energy in the spring is converted, and not again until energy is
   reapplied to the spring to rewind it. A car that has run out of gas will not run again until you
   walk 10 miles to a gas station and refuel the car. Once the potential energy locked in
   carbohydrates is converted into kinetic energy (energy in use or motion), the organism will get
   no more until energy is input again. In the process of energy transfer, some energy will
   dissipate as heat. Entropy is a measure of disorder: cells are NOT disordered and so have low
   entropy. The flow of energy maintains order and life. Entropy wins when organisms cease to take
   in energy and die.

Potential vs. Kinetic energy | Back to Top

   Potential energy, as the name implies, is energy that has not yet been used, thus the term
   potential. Kinetic energy is energy in use (or motion). A tank of gasoline has a certain
   potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy by the engine. When the potential is used
   up, you're outta gas! Batteries, when new or recharged, have a certain potential. When placed
   into a tape recorder and played at loud volume (the only settings for such things), the
   potential in the batteries is transformed into kinetic energy to drive the speakers. When the
   potential energy is all used up, the batteries are dead. In the case of rechargeable batteries,
   their potential is reelevated or restored.

   In the hydrologic cycle, the sun is the ultimate source of energy, evaporating water (in a
   fashion raising it's potential above water in the ocean). When the water falls as rain (or snow)
   it begins to run downhill toward sea-level. As the water get closer to sea-level, it's potential
   energy is decreased. Without the sun, the water would eventually still reach sea-level, but
   never be evaporated to recharge the cycle.

   Chemicals may also be considered from a potential energy or kinetic energy standpoint. One pound
   of sugar has a certain potential energy. If that pound of sugar is burned the energy is released
   all at once. The energy released is kinetic energy (heat). So much is released that organisms
   would burn up if all the energy was released at once. Organisms must release the energy a little
   bit at a time.

   Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Cells convert potential energy, usually in the from
   of C-C covalent bonds or ATP molecules, into kinetic energy to accomplish cell division, growth,
   biosynthesis, and active transport, among other things.

Learning Objectives | Back to Top

   These learning objectives are taken from my Biology for Nonmajors class (BIO 102). I have tried
   to add a link to each that will direct you to a part of this chapter or another website that
   will facilitate your completion of the objective.
    1. Define energy; be able to state the first and second laws of thermodynamics.
    2. Entropy is a measure of the degree of randomness or disorder of systems. Explain how life
       maintains a high degree of organization.
