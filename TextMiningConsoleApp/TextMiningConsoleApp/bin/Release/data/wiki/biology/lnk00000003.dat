                                                  I

   ice age Interval of geologic time between 2 million and 10,000 years ago during which the
   northern hemisphere experienced several episodes of continental glacial advance and retreat
   along with a climatic cooling. The icing over of Antarctica was also completed during this time.

   ileum  The third and last section of the small intestine. PICTURE

   immovable joint  A joint in which the bones interlock and are held together by Þbers or bony
   processes that prevent the joint from moving; e.g., the bones of the cranium.

   immune system  One of the eleven major body organ systems in vertebrates; defends the internal
   environment against invading microorganisms and viruses and provides defense against the growth
   of cancer cells.

   immunoglobulins  The Þve classes of protein to which antibodies belong (IgD, IgM, IgG, IgA,
   IgE). PICTURE

   implantation  The process in which the blastocyst embeds in the endometrium. PICTURE

   incomplete dominance  A type of inheritance in which the heterozygote has a phenotype
   intermediate to those of the homozygous parents. PICTURE

   incomplete flower Condition in which one or more "typical" flower parts are absent. Example:
   grass flowers such as corn tassels which are male.

   incus One of the three bones comprising the middle ear of mammals.

   inflammation  A reaction to the invasion of microorganisms through the skin or through the
   epithelial layers of the respiratory, digestive, or urinary system; characterized by four signs:
   redness, swelling, heat, and pain.

   inflammatory response  The body's reaction to invading infectious microorganisms; includes an
   increase in blood þow to the affected area, the release of chemicals that draw white blood
   cells, an increased þow of plasma, and the arrival of monocytes to clean up the debris.

   ingestive feeders  Animals that ingest food through a mouth.

   inheritance of acquired characteristics Lamarck's view that features acquired during an
   organism's lifetime would be passed on to succeeding generations, leading to inheritable change
   in species over time.

   initiation  The Þrst step in translation; occurs when a messenger RNA molecule, a ribosomal
   subunit, and a transfer RNA molecule carrying the Þrst amino acid bind together to form a
   complex; begins at the start codon on mRNA.

   initiation codon (AUG) Three-base sequence on the messenger RNA that codes for the amino acid
   methionine; the start command for protein synthesis.

   insertion A type of mutation in which a new DNA base is inserted into an existing sequence of
   DNA bases. This shifts the reference frame in protein synthesis, resulting (sometimes) in
   altered amino acid sequences.

   insulin  A hormone secreted by the pancreas that stimulates the uptake of glucose by body cells.
   Insulin works antagonistically with glucagon to control blood sugar levels.

   integration  The process of combining incoming information; one of the functions of the nervous
   system.

   integument  Something that covers or encloses, e.g., the skin.

   integumentary system  The skin and its derivatives (hair, nails, feathers, horns, antlers, and
   glands), which in multicellular animals protect against invading foreign microorganisms and
   prevent the loss or exchange of internal þuids. PICTURE

   interferons  Proteins released by cells in response to viral infection; activate the synthesis
   and secretion of antiviral proteins.

   internal environment  In multicellular organisms, the aqueous environment that is outside the
   cells but inside the body.

   interneurons  Neurons that process signals from one or more sensory neurons and relay signals to
   motor neurons. Aka connector neurons.

   internodes  The stem regions between nodes in plants.

   interphase  The period between cell divisions when growth and replacement occur in preparation
   for the next division; consists of gap 1 (G1), synthesis (S), and gap 2 (G2). PICTURE

   interstitial  Being situated within a particular organ or tissue.

   interstitial fluid  Fluid surrounding the cells in body tissues; provides a path through which
   nutrients, gases, and wastes can travel between the capillaries and the cells.

   intracellular digestion  A form of digestion in which food is taken into cells by phagocytosis;
   found in sponges and most protozoa and coelenterates.

   intracellular parasites  Viruses that enter a host cell and take over the host's cellular
   machinery to produce new viral particles.

   intracellular route Path taken by water through the cells of the root between the epidermis and
   the xylem, moving through plasmodesmata. PICTURE

   intron In eukaryotes, bases of a gene transcribed but later excised from the mRNA prior to
   exporting from the nucleus and subsequent translation of the message into a polypeptide. PICTURE

   inversion  A reversal in the order of genes on a chromosome segment.

   ion  An atom that has lost or gained electrons from its outer shell and therefore has a positive
   or negative charge, respectively; symbolized by a superscript plus or minus sign and sometimes a
   number, e.g., H^+, Na^+1, Cl^-2.

   ionic bond  A chemical bond in which atoms of opposite charge are held together by electrostatic
   attraction.

   isotonic  Term applied to two solutions with equal solute concentrations.

   isotopes  Atoms with the same atomic number but different numbers of neutrons; indicated by
   adding the mass number to the element's name, e.g., carbon 12 or ^12C.
