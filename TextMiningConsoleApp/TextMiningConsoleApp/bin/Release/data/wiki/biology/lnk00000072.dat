   The plant kingdom contains multicellular phototrophs that usually live on land. The earliest
   plant fossils are from terrestrial deposits, although some plants have since returned to the
   water. All plant cells have a cell wall containing the carbohydrate cellulose, and often have
   plastids in their cytoplasm. The plant life cycle has an alternation between haploid
   (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) generations. There are more than 300,000 living species
   of plants known, as well as an extensive fossil record.

   Plants divide into two groups: plants lacking lignin-impregnated conducting cells (the
   nonvascular plants) and those containing lignin-impregnated conducting cells (the vascular
   plants). Living groups of nonvascular plants include the bryophytes: liverworts, hornworts, and
   mosses. Vascular plants are the more common plants like pines, ferns, corn, and oaks. The
   phylogenetic relationships within the plant kingdom are shown in Figure 1.

  Evolution of Plants | Back to Top

   Fossil and biochemical evidence indicates plants are descended from multicellular green algae.
   Various green algal groups have been proposed for this ancestral type, with the Charophytes
   often being prominently mentioned. Cladistic studies support the inclusion of the Charophytes
   (including the taxonomic order Coleochaetales) as sister taxa to the land plants. Algae
   dominated the oceans of the precambrian time over 700 million years ago. Between 500 and 400
   million years ago, some algae made the transition to land, becoming plants by developing a
   series of adaptations to help them survive out of the water.

   Vascular plants appeared by 350 million years ago, with forests soon following by 300 million
   years ago. Seed plants next evolved, with flowering plants appearing around 140 million years
   ago. This pattern is shown in Figure 2.

  The Plant Life Cycle | Back to Top

   Plants have an alternation of generations: the diploid spore-producing plant (sporophyte)
   alternates with the haploid gamete-producing plant (gametophyte), as shown in Figure 3. Animal
   life cycles have meiosis followed immediately by gametogenesis. Gametes are produced directly by
   meiosis. Male gametes are sperm. Female gametes are eggs or ova.

   Figure 3. Typical alternation of generations life cycle, such as occur in some protistans and
   plants. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer
   Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                           [lifecycle.gif]

   The plant life cycle has mitosis occurring in spores, produced by meiosis, that germinate into
   the gametophyte phase. Gametophyte size ranges from three cells (in pollen) to several million
   (in a "lower plant" such as moss). Alternation of generations occurs in plants, where the
   sporophyte phase is succeeded by the gametophyte phase. The sporophyte phase produces spores by
   meiosis within a sporangium. The gametophyte phase produces gametes by mitosis within an
   antheridium (producing sperm) and/or archegonium (producing eggs). These different stages of the
   flowering plant life cycle are shown in Figure 4. Within the plant kingdom the dominance of
   phases varies. Nonvascular plants, the mosses and liverworts, have the gametophyte phase
   dominant. Vascular plants show a progression of increasing sporophyte dominance from the ferns
   and "fern allies" to angiosperms.

    Homospory and Heterospory

   Plants have two further variations on their life cycles. Plants that produce bisexual
   gametophytes have those gametophytes germinate from isospores (iso=same) that are about all the
   same size. This state is referred to as homospory (sometimes referred to as isospory). A
   generalized homosporous plant life cycle is shown in Figure 5. Homosporous plants produce
   bisexual gametophytes. Ferns are a classic example of a homosporous plant.

   Figure 5. A typical homosporous life cycle. Note the production of a single type of bisexual
   gametophyte that will eventually produce the antheridia (sperm bearing structures) and
   archegonia (egg bearing structures). Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th
   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with

                                          [lifecycles_1.gif]

   Plants that produce separate male and female gametophytes have those gametophytes germinate from
   (or within in the case of the more advanced plants) spores of different sizes (heterospores;
   hetero=different). The male gametophyte produces sperm, and is associated with smaller or
   microspores. The female gametophyte is associated with the larger or megaspores. Heterospory is
   considered by botanists as a significant step toward the development of the seed. A generalized
   heterosporous life cycle is shown in Figure 6.

   Figure 6. Typical heterosporous life cycle. Note the production of separate, unisexual male and
   female gametophytes. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by

  Plant Adaptations to Life on Land | Back to Top

   Organisms in water do not face many of the challenges that terrestrial creatures do. Water
   supports the organism, the moist surface of the creature is a superb surface for gas exchange,
   etc. For organisms to exist on land, a variety of challenges must be met.
    1. Drying out. Once removed from water and exposed to air, organisms must deal with the need to
       conserve water. A number of approaches have developed, such as the development of waterproof
       skin (in animals), living in very moist environments (amphibians, bryophytes), and
       production of a waterproof surface (the cuticle in plants, cork layers and bark in woody
       trees).
    2. Gas exchange. Organisms that live in water are often able to exchange carbon dioxide and
       oxygen gases through their surfaces. These exchange surfaces are moist, thin layers across
       which diffusion can occur. Organismal response to the challenge of drying out tends to make
       these surfaces thicker, waterproof, and to retard gas exchange. Consequently, another method
       of gas exchange must be modified or developed. Many fish already had gills and swim
       bladders, so when some of them began moving between ponds, the swim bladder (a gas retention
       structure helping buoyancy in the fish) began to act as a gas exchange surface, ultimately
       evolving into the terrestrial lung. Many arthropods had gills or other internal respiratory
       surfaces that were modified to facilitate gas exchange on land. Plants are thought to share
       common ancestry with algae. The plant solution to gas exchange is a new structure, the guard
       cells that flank openings (stomata) in the above ground parts of the plant. By opening these
       guard cells the plant is able to allow gas exchange by diffusion through the open stomata.
    3. Support. Organisms living in water are supported by the dense liquid they live in. Once on
       land, the organisms had to deal with the less dense air, which could not support their
       weight. Adaptations to this include animal skeletons and specialized plant cells/tissues
       that support the plant.
    4. Conduction. Single celled organisms only have tyo move materials in, out, and within their
       cells. A multicellular creature must do this at each cell in the body, plus move material
       in, out, and within the organism. Adaptations to this include the circulatory systems of
       animals, and the specialized conducting tissues xylem and phloem in plants. Some
       multicellular algae and bryophytes also have specialized conducting cells.
    5. Reproduction. Organisms in water can release their gametes into the water, where the gametes
       will swim by flagella until they ecounter each other and fertilization happens. On land,
       such a scenario is not possible. Land animals have had to develop specialized reproductive
       systems involving fertilization when they return to water (amphibians), or internal
       fertilization and an amniotic egg (reptiles, birds, and mammals). Insects developed similar
       mechanisms. Plants have also had to deal with this, either by living in moist environments
       like the ferns and bryophytes do, or by developing specialized delivery systems like pollen
       tubes to get the sperm cells to the egg.

  Bryophytes | Back to Top

   Bryophytes are small, nonvascular plants that first evolved approximately 500 million years ago.
   The earliest land plants were most likely bryophytes. Bryophytes lack vascular tissue and have
   life cycles dominated by the gametophyte phase, as shown in Figure 7. The lack of conducting
   cells limits the size of the plants, generally keeping them under 5 inches high. Roots are
   absent in bryophytes, instead there are root-like structures known as rhizoids. Bryophytes
   include the hornworts, liverworts, and mosses.

  Tracheophytes: The Vascular Plants | Back to Top

   The vascular plants have specialized transporting cells xylem (for transporting water and
   mineral nutrients) and phloem (for transporting sugars from leaves to the rest of the plant).
   When we think of plants we invariably picture vascular plants. Vascular plants tend to be larger
   and more complex than bryophytes, and have a life cycle where the sporophyte is more prominent
   than the gametophyte. Vascular plants also demonstrate increased levels of organization by
   having organs and organ systems. The novel features oif the vascular plants are summarized in
   Table 2.

  Vascular Plant Groups | Back to Top

   Vascular plants first developed during the Silurian Period, about 400 million years ago. The
   earliest vascular plants had no roots, leaves, fruits, or flowers, and reproduced by producing
   spores.

   Cooksonia, shown in Figure 8, is a typical early vascular plant. It was less than 15 cm tall,
   with stems that dichotomously branched. Dichotomous branching (where the stem divides into two
   ewqual branches) appears a primitive or ancestral trait in vascular plants. Some branches
   terminated in sporangia that produced a single size of spore.

   Many scientists now consider "Cooksonia" an evolutionary grade rather than a true monophyletic
   taxon. Their main argument is that not all stems of Cooksonia-type plants have vascular tissue.
   The evolutionary situation of a grade would have some members of the group having the trait,
   others not. The shapes of sporangia on various specimens of Cooksonia also vary considerably.

                                    [Cooksonia.jpeg] [ElpD10.gif]

   Rhynia, shown in Figure 9, is another early vascular plant. Like Cooksonia, it lacked leaves and
   roots. One of the species formerly assigned to this genus, R. major, has since been reclassified
   as Aglaophyton major. Some paleobotanists consider A. major (Figure 10) a bryophyte, however, it
   does have a separate free-living sporophyte that is more prominent than the sporophyte, but
   appears to lack lignified conducting cells. The remaining species, R. gwynne-vaughanii is an
   undoubted vascular plant.

   Devonian plant lines included the trimerophytes and zosterophyllophytes, which have been
   interpreted as related to ferns and lycophytes.

  The Psilophytes | Back to Top

   The Division Psilophyta consists of Psilotum nudum (the whisk fern, shown in Figure 11), a
   living plant that resembling what paleobotanists believe Cooksonia to have been: a naked,
   photosynthetic stem bearing sporangia. Also in the group is Tmesipteris, which resembles
   Psilotum except for its possession of smallo vascularized leaves arising on opposite sides of
   the stem. However, most paleobotanists doubt that Psilotum is a direct descendant of Cooksonia.
   Molecular studies suggest an affiliation with ferns for Psilotum. Psilotum also has three fused
   sporangia, termed a synangium, located on the sides of the stems (instead of the tips of stems
   as in Cooksonia).

   Figure 11. Psilotum nudum from Hawaii. Note the synangia, the roundish structures on the side of
   the green stems. Image from http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/carr/images/psi_nud_mid.jpg.

                                          [psi_nud_mid.jpg]

  The Lycophytes | Back to Top

   The next group, the Division Lycophyta, have their sporangia organized into strobili (singular:
   strobilus). A strobilus is a series of sporangia and modified leaves closely grouped on a stem
   tip. The leaves in strobili are soft and fleshy as opposed to the hard, modified leaves in
   cones.

   Leaves that contained vascular tissue are another major advance for this group. The presumed
   evolutionary pathway for the leaf is shown in Figure 12. The leaves in lycophytes, both living
   and fossil forms, are known as microphylls. This term does not imply any size constraint, but
   rather refers to the absence of a leaf gap in the vascular supply of the stem at the point where
   the leaf vascular trace departs. Ferns and other plants have megaphylls, leaves that produce
   this leaf gap.

   Figure 12. Proposed steps in the evolution of the microphyll leaf. Note that microphylls do not
   leave a leaf gap in the stem's vascular cylinder. If we wanted to place Psilotum-like plants on
   the left top, we would have Lycopodium-like plants on the right top. Image from Purves et al.,
   Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH
   Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                           [leafevol_1.gif]

   Today there are fewer genera of lycophytes than during the group's heyday, the Paleozoic Era.
   Major living lycophytes include Lycopodium (commonly called the club moss [shown in Figure 13],
   although it is NOT a moss), Isoetes, and Selaginella (the so-called resurrection plant).
   Lycopodium produces isospores that germinate in the soil and produce a bisexual gametophyte.
   These spores are all approximately the same size. Selaginella and Isoetes are heterosporous, and
   thus produce two sizes of spores: small spores (termed microspores) that germinate to produce
   the male gametophyte; and larger spores (megaspores) that germinate to produce the female
   gametophyte. The production of two sizes of spores, and also making separate unisexual
   gametophytes, is thought an important step toward the seed. Modern lycophytes are small,
   herbaceous plants. Many of the prominent fossil members of this group produced large amounts of
   wood and were significant trees in the Carboniferous-aged coal swamps.

   Figure 13. Lycopodium venustulum, from from Hawaii. Note the strobili on the tips of the stems,
   as well as the stems covered with numerous spirally arranged microphylls. Image from

                                            [lyc_ven.jpg]

   Selaginella is a heterosporous member of the lycophytes. Some species of this genus are able to
   withstand drying out by going dormant until they are rehydrated. For this reason these forms of
   the genus are commonly called resurrection plants. An example of this is shown in Figure 14.

   part shows the resurrected or rehydrated plant. Image from

    Fossil Lycophytes: Baragwanathia and Drepanophycus

   Baragwanathia, shown in Figure 15, is an undoubted lycophyte from the middle Silurian deposits
   of Australia. It has microphyllous leaves spirally attached to the stem, and sporangia clustered
   in some areas of the plant, although not in terminal strobili as in modern lycophytes.

   Figure 15. Left: Reconstruction of Baragwanathia longifolia, from the middle Silurian of
   Australia. Image from http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/IB181/VPL/Lyco/Lyco1.html; Right:
   Reconstruction of Drepanophycus , a middle Devonian lycophyte. Note the numerous microphyll
   leaves, placement of sporangia on the upper surface of the sporophylls, and stem anatomy that
   are all consistent with modern lycophytes. Image from
   http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/IB181/VPL/Lyco/Lyco2.html.

                                      [LycoD5.gif] [drepano.gif]

   Drepanophycus is a middle Devonian lycophyte from the Northern Hemisphere, also shown in Figure
   15. Its features are very similar to modern lycophytes.

    Lepidodendron and Sigillaria

   The Lycophytes became significant elements of the world's flora during the Carboniferous time
   (the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are terms used for this time span in the United States).
   These non-seed plants evolved into trees placed in the fossil genera Lepidodendron and
   Sigillaria, with heights reaching up to 40 meters and 20-30 meters respectively. Lepidodendron
   stems are composed of less wood (secondary xylem) that usually is found in gymnosperm and
   angiosperm trees.

   We know much about the anatomy of these coal-age lycopods because of an odd type of preservation
   known as a coal ball. Coal balls can be peeled and the plants that are anatomically preserved
   within them laboriously studied to learn the details of cell structure of these coal age plants.
   Additionally, we have some exceptional petrifactions and compressions that reveal different
   layers of the plants' structure. Estimates place the bulk, up to 70%, of coal material as being
   derived from lycophytes.

   Lepidodendron, pictured in Figures 16 and 17, was a heterosporous lycophyte tree common in coal
   swamps of the Carboniferous time. As with many large plant fossils, one rarely if ever finds the
   entire tree preserved intact. Consequently there are a number of fossil plant genera that are
   "organ taxa" and represent only the leaves (such as Lepidophylloides), reproductive structures
   (Lepidostrobus), stem (Lepidodendron), spores (Lycospora), and roots (Stigmaria). Lepidodendron
   had leaves borne spirally on branches that dichotomously forked, with roots also arising
   spirally from the stigmarian axes, and both small (microspores) and large (megaspores) formed in
   strobili (a loose type of soft cone). Lepidodendron may have attained heigths of nearly 40
   meters, with trunks nearly 2 meters in diameter. The trees branched extensively and produced a
   large number of leaves. When these leaves fell from the branches, they left behind them the leaf
   scars characteristic of the genus.

   Figure 16. External stem features typical of arborescent lycopods, collectively called
   lepidodendrids, based on the diamond-shaped "snakeskin" type pattern produced by the helically
   arranged leaf cushions. On the left is a lower magnification view of this type of pattern,
   showing the general features of many of these trees. Each leaf abscissed, so that if you are
   looking, as you are here, at the outside of the stem, you can see a characteristic appearance.
   On the right is a higher magnification photo showing details of leaf cushions. Each diamond
   shaped cushion has a smaller central area called the leaf base where the leaf attached. In the
   center of the leaf base you can see the leaf trace, or vein to the leaf. The vertical stripe
   running down each cushion is probably the result of increased girth from secondary cortical
   growth inside the stem. Images and text from

   Sigillaria was another arborescent lycopod, and is also common in coal-age deposits. In contrast
   to the spirally borne leaves of Lepidodendron, Sigillaria had leaved arranged in vertical rows
   along the stem.

  The Sphenophyta | Back to Top

   The Division Sphenophyta contains once dominant plants (both arborescent as well as herbaceous)
   in Paleozoic forests, equisetophytes are today relegated to minor roles as herbaceous plants.
   Today only a single genus, Equisetum, survives. The group is defined by their jointed stems,
   with many leaves being produced at a node, production of isospores in cones borne at the tips of
   stems, and spores bearing elaters (devices to aid in spore dispersal). Sporophyte features are
   seen in Figure 18. The gametophyte is small, bisexual, photosynthetic, and free-living. Silica
   concentrated in the stems give this group one of their common names: scouring rushes. These
   plants were reportedly used by American pioneers to scour the pots and pans. The fossil members
   of this group are often encountered in coal deposits of Carboniferous age in North America and
   Europe.

  The Ferns | Back to Top

   Ferns reproduce by spores from which the free-living bisexual gametophyte generation develops.
   There are 12,000 species of ferns today, placed in the Division Pteridophyta. The fossil history
   of ferns shows them to have been a dominant plant group during the Paleozoic Era. Most ferns
   have pinnate leaves, exhibiting small leaflets on a frond, as shown in Figure 19. Ferns have
   megaphyllous leaves, which cause a leaf gap in the vascular cylinder of the stem/rhizome, as
   shown in Figure 20. The first ferns also appear by the end of the Devonian. Some anatomical
   similarities suggest that ferns and sphenophytes may have shared a common ancestor within the
   trimerophytes.

   Figure 19. Three genera of the fern family Gleicheniaceae from Hawaii: Upper left: Sticheris
   owhyhensis, lower left: Diploterygium pinnatum (uluhe lau nui), right: Dicranopteris linearis
   (uluhe). Image from http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/carr/gleicheni.htm.

    The Fern Life Cycle

   The fern gametophyte has both sexes present and is referred to as a prothallium. Prothallia
   develop from spores shed from the underside of the sporophyte leaves, shown in Figure 21. Once
   fertilization occurs, the next generation sporophyte develops from the egg located in the
   prothallium.

Learning Objectives | Back to Top

     * Be able to discuss the differences in life cycle between vascular and nonvascular plants.
     * Both bryophytes and vascular plants have leaf-like structures. Be able to prepare a single
       sentence that can tell the reader what a leaf is, as well as what it is not.
     * Both heterospory and homospory impose certain constraints on the gametophyte generation.
       List some of these.
     * Be able to compare and contrast the typical plant life cycle and a typical animal one.
     * Psilotum is NOT a primitive vascular plant, but rather has more genetic similarity to ferns.
       What sorts of information might we gather from studying modern Psilotum and its ecology as
       it relates to Cooksonia and other early vascular plants.
     * What are the chief differences between vascular and nonvascular plants?
     * The fern gametophyte is bisexual. Speculate on the evolutionary advantages of this in fern
       colonization of ecologically disturbed areas.
