  The Neuron | Back to Top

   Nervous tissue is composed of two main cell types: neurons and glial cells. Neurons transmit
   nerve messages. Glial cells are in direct contact with neurons and often surround them.

   The neuron is the functional unit of the nervous system. Humans have about 100 billion neurons
   in their brain alone! While variable in size and shape, all neurons have three parts. Dendrites
   receive information from another cell and transmit the message to the cell body. The cell body
   contains the nucleus, mitochondria and other organelles typical of eukaryotic cells. The axon
   conducts messages away from the cell body.

   Three types of neurons occur. Sensory neurons typically have a long dendrite and short axon, and
   carry messages from sensory receptors to the central nervous system. Motor neurons have a long
   axon and short dendrites and transmit messages from the central nervous system to the muscles
   (or to glands). Interneurons are found only in the central nervous system where they connect
   neuron to neuron.

   Some axons are wrapped in a myelin sheath formed from the plasma membranes of specialized glial
   cells known as Schwann cells. Schwann cells serve as supportive, nutritive, and service
   facilities for neurons. The gap between Schwann cells is known as the node of Ranvier, and
   serves as points along the neuron for generating a signal. Signals jumping from node to node
   travel hundreds of times faster than signals traveling along the surface of the axon. This
   allows your brain to communicate with your toes in a few thousandths of a second.

  The Nerve Message | Back to Top

   The plasma membrane of neurons, like all other cells, has an unequal distribution of ions and
   electrical charges between the two sides of the membrane. The outside of the membrane has a
   positive charge, inside has a negative charge. This charge difference is a resting potential and
   is measured in millivolts. Passage of ions across the cell membrane passes the electrical charge
   along the cell. The voltage potential is -65mV (millivolts) of a cell at rest (resting
   potential). Resting potential results from differences between sodium and potassium positively
   charged ions and negatively charged ions in the cytoplasm. Sodium ions are more concentrated
   outside the membrane, while potassium ions are more concentrated inside the membrane. This
   imbalance is maintained by the active transport of ions to reset the membrane known as the
   sodium potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump maintains this unequal concentration by
   actively transporting ions against their concentration gradients.

                                             [actpot.gif]

   Transmission of an action potential. The above image is from
   http://eleceng.ukc.ac.uk/~sd5/pics/research/big/actpot.gif.

   Changed polarity of the membrane, the action potential, results in propagation of the nerve
   impulse along the membrane. An action potential is a temporary reversal of the electrical
   potential along the membrane for a few milliseconds. Sodium gates and potassium gates open in
   the membrane to allow their respective ions to cross. Sodium and potassium ions reverse
   positions by passing through membrane protein channel gates that can be opened or closed to
   control ion passage. Sodium crosses first. At the height of the membrane potential reversal,
   potassium channels open to allow potassium ions to pass to the outside of the membrane.
   Potassium crosses second, resulting in changed ionic distributions, which must be reset by the
   continuously running sodium-potassium pump. Eventually enough potassium ions pass to the outside
   to restore the membrane charges to those of the original resting potential.The cell begins then
   to pump the ions back to their original sides of the membrane.

   The action potential begins at one spot on the membrane, but spreads to adjacent areas of the
   membrane, propagating the message along the length of the cell membrane. After passage of the
   action potential, there is a brief period, the refractory period, during which the membrane
   cannot be stimulated. This prevents the message from being transmitted backward along the
   membrane.

    Steps in an Action Potential

    1. At rest the outside of the membrane is more positive than the inside.
    2. Sodium moves inside the cell causing an action potential, the influx of positive sodium ions
       makes the inside of the membrane more positive than the outside.
    3. Potassium ions flow out of the cell, restoring the resting potential net charges.
    4. Sodium ions are pumped out of the cell and potassium ions are pumped into the cell,
       restoring the original distribution of ions.

    Synapses

   The junction between a nerve cell and another cell is called a synapse. Messages travel within
   the neuron as an electrical action potential. The space between two cells is known as the
   synaptic cleft. To cross the synaptic cleft requires the actions of neurotransmitters.
   Neurotransmitters are stored in small synaptic vessicles clustered at the tip of the axon.

                                            [synapse.gif]

   Arrival of the action potential causes some of the vesicles to move to the end of the axon and
   discharge their contents into the synaptic cleft. Released neurotransmitters diffuse across the
   cleft, and bind to receptors on the other cell's membrane, causing ion channels on that cell to
   open. Some neurotransmitters cause an action potential, others are inhibitory.

   Neurotransmitters tend to be small molecules, some are even hormones. The time for
   neurotransmitter action is between 0,5 and 1 millisecond. Neurotransmitters are either destroyed
   by specific enzymes in the synaptic cleft, diffuse out of the cleft, or are reabsorbed by the
   cell. More than 30 organic molecules are thought to act as neurotransmitters. The
   neurotransmitters cross the cleft, binding to receptor molecules on the next cell, prompting
   transmission of the message along that cell's membrane. Acetylcholine is an example of a
   neurotransmitter, as is norepinephrine, although each acts in different responses. Once in the
   cleft, neurotransmitters are active for only a short time. Enzymes in the cleft inactivate the
   neurotransmitters. Inactivated neurotransmitters are taken back into the axon and recycled.

   Diseases that affect the function of signal transmission can have serious consequences.
   Parkinson's disease has a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Progressive death of
   brain cells increases this deficit, causing tremors, rigidity and unstable posture. L-dopa is a
   chemical related to dopamine that eases some of the symptoms (by acting as a substitute
   neurotransmitter) but cannot reverse the progression of the disease.

   The bacterium Clostridium tetani produces a toxin that prevents the release of GABA. GABA is
   important in control of skeletal muscles. Without this control chemical, regulation of muscle
   contraction is lost; it can be fatal when it effects the muscles used in breathing.

   Clostridium botulinum produces a toxin found in improperly canned foods. This toxin causes the
   progressive relaxation of muscles, and can be fatal. A wide range of drugs also operate in the
   synapses: cocaine, LSD, caffeine, and insecticides.

  Nervous Systems | Back to Top

   Multicellular animals must monitor and maintain a constant internal environment as well as
   monitor and respond to an external environment. In many animals, these two functions are
   coordinated by two integrated and coordinated organ systems: the nervous system and the
   endocrine system. Click here for a diagram of the Nervous System.

   Three basic functions are prformed by nervous systems:
    1. Receive sensory input from internal and external environments
    2. Integrate the input
    3. Respond to stimuli

    Sensory Input

   Receptors are parts of the nervous system that sense changes in the internal or external
   environments. Sensory input can be in many forms, including pressure, taste, sound, light, blood
   pH, or hormone levels, that are converted to a signal and sent to the brain or spinal cord.

    Integration and Output

   In the sensory centers of the brain or in the spinal cord, the barrage of input is integrated
   and a response is generated. The response, a motor output, is a signal transmitted to organs
   than can convert the signal into some form of action, such as movement, changes in heart rate,
   release of hormones, etc.

    Endocrine Systems

   Some animals have a second control system, the endocrine system. The nervous system coordinates
   rapid responses to external stimuli. The endocrine system controls slower, longer lasting
   responses to internal stimuli. Activity of both systems is integrated.

    Divisions of the Nervous System

   The nervous system monitors and controls almost every organ system through a series of positive
   and negative feedback loops.The Central Nervous System (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord.
   The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) connects the CNS to other parts of the body, and is composed
   of nerves (bundles of neurons).

   Not all animals have highly specialized nervous systems. Those with simple systems tend to be
   either small and very mobile or large and immobile. Large, mobile animals have highly developed
   nervous systems: the evolution of nervous systems must have been an important adaptation in the
   evolution of body size and mobility.

   Coelenterates, cnidarians, and echinoderms have their neurons organized into a nerve net. These
   creatures have radial symmetry and lack a head. Although lacking a brain or either nervous
   system (CNS or PNS) nerve nets are capable of some complex behavior.

                                           [nervsys_1.gif]

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   Bilaterally symmetrical animals have a body plan that includes a defined head and a tail region.
   Development of bilateral symmetry is associated with cephalization, the development of a head
   with the accumulation of sensory organs at the front end of the organism. Flatworms have neurons
   associated into clusters known as ganglia, which in turn form a small brain. Vertebrates have a
   spinal cord in addition to a more developed brain.

                                           [nervsys_2.gif]

   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

   Chordates have a dorsal rather than ventral nervous system. Several evolutionary trends occur in
   chordates: spinal cord, continuation of cephalization in the form of larger and more complex
   brains, and development of a more elaborate nervous system. The vertebrate nervous system is
   divided into a number of parts. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord.
   The peripheral nervous system consists of all body nerves. Motor neuron pathways are of two
   types: somatic (skeletal) and autonomic (smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands). The
   autonomic system is subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.

  Peripheral Nervous System | Back to Top

   The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)contains only nerves and connects the brain and spinal cord
   (CNS) to the rest of the body. The axons and dendrites are surrounded by a white myelin sheath.
   Cell bodies are in the central nervous system (CNS) or ganglia. Ganglia are collections of nerve
   cell bodies. Cranial nerves in the PNS take impulses to and from the brain (CNS). Spinal nerves
   take impulses to and away from the spinal cord. There are two major subdivisions of the PNS
   motor pathways: the somatic and the autonomic.

   Two main components of the PNS:
    1. sensory (afferent) pathways that provide input from the body into the CNS.
    2. motor (efferent) pathways that carry signals to muscles and glands (effectors).

   Most sensory input carried in the PNS remains below the level of conscious awareness. Input that
   does reach the conscious level contributes to perception of our external environment.

  Somatic Nervous System | Back to Top

   The Somatic Nervous System (SNS) includes all nerves controlling the muscular system and
   external sensory receptors. External sense organs (including skin) are receptors. Muscle fibers
   and gland cells are effectors. The reflex arc is an automatic, involuntary reaction to a
   stimulus. When the doctor taps your knee with the rubber hammer, she/he is testing your reflex
   (or knee-jerk). The reaction to the stimulus is involuntary, with the CNS being informed but not
   consciously controlling the response. Examples of reflex arcs include balance, the blinking
   reflex, and the stretch reflex.

   Sensory input from the PNS is processed by the CNS and responses are sent by the PNS from the
   CNS to the organs of the body.

   Motor neurons of the somatic system are distinct from those of the autonomic system. Inhibitory
   signals, cannot be sent through the motor neurons of the somatic system.

  Autonomic Nervous System | Back to Top

   The Autonomic Nervous System is that part of PNS consisting of motor neurons that control
   internal organs. It has two subsystems. The autonomic system controls muscles in the heart, the
   smooth muscle in internal organs such as the intestine, bladder, and uterus. The Sympathetic
   Nervous System is involved in the fight or flight response. The Parasympathetic Nervous System
   is involved in relaxation. Each of these subsystems operates in the reverse of the other
   (antagonism). Both systems innervate the same organs and act in opposition to maintain
   homeostasis. For example: when you are scared the sympathetic system causes your heart to beat
   faster; the parasympathetic system reverses this effect.

   Motor neurons in this system do not reach their targets directly (as do those in the somatic
   system) but rather connect to a secondary motor neuron which in turn innervates the target
   organ.

   Click here for a diagram of the Autonomic Nervous System.

  Central Nervous System | Back to Top

   The Central Nervous System (CNS) is composed of the brain and spinal cord. The CNS is surrounded
   by bone-skull and vertebrae. Fluid and tissue also insulate the brain and spinal cord.

                                             [brain.gif]

   Areas of the brain. The above image is from
   http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/schools/PHS/Science_Dept/APBio/pic/brain.gif.

   The brain is composed of three parts: the cerebrum (seat of consciousness), the cerebellum, and
   the medulla oblongata (these latter two are "part of the unconscious brain").

   The medulla oblongata is closest to the spinal cord, and is involved with the regulation of
   heartbeat, breathing, vasoconstriction (blood pressure), and reflex centers for vomiting,
   coughing, sneezing, swallowing, and hiccuping. The hypothalamus regulates homeostasis. It has
   regulatory areas for thirst, hunger, body temperature, water balance, and blood pressure, and
   links the Nervous System to the Endocrine System. The midbrain and pons are also part of the
   unconscious brain. The thalamus serves as a central relay point for incoming nervous messages.

   The cerebellum is the second largest part of the brain, after the cerebrum. It functions for
   muscle coordination and maintains normal muscle tone and posture. The cerebellum coordinates
   balance.

   The conscious brain includes the cerebral hemispheres, which are are separated by the corpus
   callosum. In reptiles, birds, and mammals, the cerebrum coordinates sensory data and motor
   functions. The cerebrum governs intelligence and reasoning, learning and memory. While the cause
   of memory is not yet definitely known, studies on slugs indicate learning is accompanied by a
   synapse decrease. Within the cell, learning involves change in gene regulation and increased
   ability to secrete transmitters.

  The Brain | Back to Top

   During embryonic development, the brain first forms as a tube, the anterior end of which
   enlarges into three hollow swellings that form the brain, and the posterior of which develops
   into the spinal cord. Some parts of the brain have changed little during vertebrate evolutionary
   history. Click here to view an diagram of the brain, and here for a clickable map of the brain.

                                            [brain_3.gif]

   Vertebrate evolutionary trends include
    1. Increase in brain size relative to body size.
    2. Subdivision and increasing specialization of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.
    3. Growth in relative size of the forebrain, especially the cerebrum, which is associated with
       increasingly complex behavior in mammals.

    The Brain Stem and Midbrain

   The brain stem is the smallest and from an evolutionary viewpoint, the oldest and most primitive
   part of the brain. The brain stem is continuous with the spinal cord, and is composed of the
   parts of the hindbrain and midbrain. The medulla oblongata and pons control heart rate,
   constriction of blood vessels, digestion and respiration.

   The midbrain consists of connections between the hindbrain and forebrain. Mammals use this part
   of the brain only for eye reflexes.

    The Cerebellum

   The cerebellum is the third part of the hindbrain, but it is not considered part of the brain
   stem. Functions of the cerebellum include fine motor coordination and body movement, posture,
   and balance. This region of the brain is enlarged in birds and controls muscle action needed for
   flight.

    The Forebrain

   The forebrain consists of the diencephalon and cerebrum. The thalamus and hypothalamus are the
   parts of the diencephalon. The thalamus acts as a switching center for nerve messages. The
   hypothalamus is a major homeostatic center having both nervous and endocrine functions.

   The cerebrum, the largest part of the human brain, is divided into left and right hemispheres
   connected to each other by the corpus callosum. The hemispheres are covered by a thin layer of
   gray matter known as the cerebral cortex, the most recently evolved region of the vertebrate
   brain. Fish have no cerebral cortex, amphibians and reptiles have only rudiments of this area.

   The cortex in each hemisphere of the cerebrum is between 1 and 4 mm thick. Folds divide the
   cortex into four lobes: occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal. No region of the brain
   functions alone, although major functions of various parts of the lobes have been determined.

   The occipital lobe (back of the head) receives and processes visual information. The temporal
   lobe receives auditory signals, processing language and the meaning of words. The parietal lobe
   is associated with the sensory cortex and processes information about touch, taste, pressure,
   pain, and heat and cold. The frontal lobe conducts three functions:
    1. motor activity and integration of muscle activity
    2. speech
    3. thought processes

   Most people who have been studied have their language and speech areas on the left hemisphere of
   their brain. Language comprehension is found in Wernicke's area. Speaking ability is in Broca's
   area. Damage to Broca's area causes speech impairment but not impairment of language
   comprehension. Lesions in Wernicke's area impairs ability to comprehend written and spoken words
   but not speech. The remaining parts of the cortex are associated with higher thought processes,
   planning, memory, personality and other human activities.

  The Spinal Cord | Back to Top

   The spinal cord runs along the dorsal side of the body and links the brain to the rest of the
   body. Vertebrates have their spinal cords encased in a series of (usually) bony vertebrae that
   comprise the vertebral column.

   The gray matter of the spinal cord consists mostly of cell bodies and dendrites. The surrounding
   white matter is made up of bundles of interneuronal axons (tracts). Some tracts are ascending
   (carrying messages to the brain), others are descending (carrying messages from the brain). The
   spinal cord is also involved in reflexes that do not immediately involve the brain.

  The Brain and Drugs | Back to Top

   Some neurotransmitters are excitory, such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and
   dopamine. Some are associated with relaxation, such as dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine release
   seems related to sensations of pleasure. Endorphins are natural opioids that produce elation and
   reduction of pain, as do artificial chemicals such as opium and heroin. Neurological diseases,
   for example Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, are due to imbalances of
   neurotransmitters. Parkinson's is due to a dopamine deficiency. Huntington's disease is thought
   to be cause by malfunctioning of an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Alzheimer's disease is
   associated with protein plaques in the brain.

   Drugs are stimulants or depressants that block or enhance certain neurotransmitters. Dopamine is
   thought involved with all forms of pleasure. Cocaine interferes with uptake of dopamine from the
   synaptic cleft. Alcohol causes a euphoric "high" followed by a depression.

   Marijuana, material from the Indian hemp plant (Cannabis sativa), has a potent chemical THC
   (tetrahydracannibinol) that in low, concentrations causes a euphoric high (if inhaled, the most
   common form of action is smoke inhalation). High dosages may cause severe effects such as
   hallucinations, anxiety, depression, and psychotic symptoms.

   Cocaine is derives from the plant Erthoxylon coca. Inhaled, smoked or injected. Cocaine users
   report a "rush" of euphoria following use. Following the rush is a short (5-30 minute) period of
   arousal followed by a depression. Repeated cycle of use terminate in a "crash" when the cocaine
   is gone. Prolonged used causes production of less dopamine, causing the user to need more of the
   drug.

   Heroin is a derivative of morphine, which in turn is obtained from opium, the milky secretions
   obtained from the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum. Heroin is usually injected intravenously,
   although snorting and smoking serve as alternative delivery methods. Heroin binds to ophioid
   receptors in the brain, where the natural chemical endorphins are involved in the cessation
   pain. Heroin is physically addictive, and prolonged use causes less endorphin production. Once
   this happens, the euphoria is no longer felt, only dependence and delay of withdrawal symptoms.

  Senses | Back to Top

   Input to the nervous system is in the form of our five senses: pain, vision, taste, smell, and
   hearing. Vision, taste, smell, and hearing input are the special senses. Pain, temperature, and
   pressure are known as somatic senses. Sensory input begins with sensors that react to stimuli in
   the form of energy that is transmitted into an action potential and sent to the CNS.

    Sensory Receptors

     * Sensory receptors are classified according to the type of energy they can detect and respond
       to.
     * Mechanoreceptors: hearing and balance, stretching.
     * Photoreceptors: light.
     * Chemoreceptors: smell and taste mainly, as well as internal sensors in the digestive and
       circulatory systems.
     * Thermoreceptors: changes in temperature.
     * Electroreceptors: detect electrical currents in the surrounding environment.

   Mechanoreceptors vary greatly in the specific type of stimulus and duration of stimulus/action
   potentials. The most adaptable vertebrate mechanoreceptor is the hair cell. Hair cells are
   present in the lateral line of fish. In humans and mammals hair cells are involved with
   detection of sound and gravity and providing balance.

    Hearing

   Hearing involves the actions of the external ear, eardrum, ossicles, and cochlea. In hearing,
   sound waves in air are converted into vibrations of a liquid then into movement of hair cells in
   the cochlea. Finally they are converted into action potentials in a sensory dendrite connected
   to the auditory nerve. Very loud sounds can cause violent vibrations in the membrane under hair
   cells, causing a shearing or permanent distortion to the cells, resulting in permanent hearing
   loss.

    Orientation and Gravity

   Orientation and gravity are detected at the semicircular canals. Hair cells along three planes
   respond to shifts of liquid within the cochlea, providing a three-dimensional sense of
   equilibrium. Calcium carbonate crystals can shift in response to gravity, providing sensory
   information about gravity and acceleration.

    Photoreceptors Detect Vision and Light Sensitivity

   The human eye can detect light in the 400-700 nanometer (nm) range, a small portion of the
   electromagnetic spectrum, the visible light spectrum. Light with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm
   is termed ultraviolet (UV) light. Light with wavelengths longer than 700 nm is termed infrared
   (IR) light.

                                            [spectrum.gif]

   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with
   permission.

    Eye

   In the eye, two types of photoreceptor cells are clustered on the retina, or back portion of the
   eye. These receptors, rods and cones, apparently evolved from hair cells. Rods detect
   differences in light intensity; cones detect color. Rods are more common in a circular zone near
   the edge of the eye. Cones occur in the center (or fovea centralis) of the retina.

   Light reaching a photoreceptor causes the breakdown of the chemical rhodopsin, which in turn
   causes a membrane potential that is transmitted to an action potential. The action potential
   transfers to synapsed neurons that connect to the optic nerve. The optic nerve connects to the
   occipital lobe of the brain.

   Humans have three types of cones, each sensitive to a different color of light: red, blue and
   green. Opsins are chemicals that bind to cone cells and make those cells sensitive to light of a
   particular wavelength (or color). Humans have three different form of opsins coded for by three
   genes on the X chromosome. Defects in one or more of these opsin genes can cause color
   blindness, usually in males.
