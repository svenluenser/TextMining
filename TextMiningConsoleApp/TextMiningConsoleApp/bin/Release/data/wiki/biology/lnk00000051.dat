  Types of Circulatory Systems | Back to Top

   Living things must be capable of transporting nutrients, wastes and gases to and from cells.
   Single-celled organisms use their cell surface as a point of exchange with the outside
   environment. Multicellular organisms have developed transport and circulatory systems to deliver
   oxygen and food to cells and remove carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes. Sponges are the
   simplest animals, yet even they have a transport system. Seawater is the medium of transport and
   is propelled in and out of the sponge by ciliary action. Simple animals, such as the hydra and
   planaria (shown in Figure 1), lack specialized organs such as hearts and blood vessels, instead
   using their skin as an exchange point for materials. This, however, limits the size an animal
   can attain. To become larger, they need specialized organs and organ systems.

   Multicellular animals do not have most of their cells in contact with the external environment
   and so have developed circulatory systems to transport nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide and
   metabolic wastes. Components of the circulatory system include
     * blood: a connective tissue of liquid plasma and cells
     * heart: a muscular pump to move the blood
     * blood vessels: arteries, capillaries and veins that deliver blood to all tissues

   There are several types of circulatory systems. The open circulatory system, examples of which
   are diagrammed in Figure 2, is common to molluscs and arthropods. Open circulatory systems
   (evolved in insects, mollusks and other invertebrates) pump blood into a hemocoel with the blood
   diffusing back to the circulatory system between cells. Blood is pumped by a heart into the body
   cavities, where tissues are surrounded by the blood. The resulting blood flow is sluggish.

   Vertebrates, and a few invertebrates, have a closed circulatory system, shown in Figure 2.
   Closed circulatory systems (evolved in echinoderms and vertebrates) have the blood closed at all
   times within vessels of different size and wall thickness. In this type of system, blood is
   pumped by a heart through vessels, and does not normally fill body cavities. Blood flow is not
   sluggish. Hemoglobin causes vertebrate blood to turn red in the presence of oxygen; but more
   importantly hemoglobin molecules in blood cells transport oxygen. The human closed circulatory
   system is sometimes called the cardiovascular system. A secondary circulatory system, the
   lymphatic circulation, collects fluid and cells and returns them to the cardiovascular system.

  Vertebrate Cardiovascular System | Back to Top

   The vertebrate cardiovascular system includes a heart, which is a muscular pump that contracts
   to propel blood out to the body through arteries, and a series of blood vessels. The upper
   chamber of the heart, the atrium (pl. atria), is where the blood enters the heart. Passing
   through a valve, blood enters the lower chamber, the ventricle. Contraction of the ventricle
   forces blood from the heart through an artery. The heart muscle is composed of cardiac muscle
   cells.

   Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from heart. Arterial walls are able to expand
   and contract. Arteries have three layers of thick walls. Smooth muscle fibers contract, another
   layer of connective tissue is quite elastic, allowing the arteries to carry blood under high
   pressure. A diagram of arterial structure is shown in Figure 3.

   The aorta is the main artery leaving the heart. The pulmonary artery is the only artery that
   carries oxygen-poor blood. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs. In the
   lungs, gas exchange occurs, carbon dioxide diffuses out, oxygen diffuses in. Arterioles are
   small arteries that connect larger arteries with capillaries. Small arterioles branch into
   collections of capillaries known as capillary beds, an exampe of one is shown in Figure 4.

   Figure 4. Structure and blood flow through a vein. The above illustration is from
   http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/schools/PHS/Science_Dept/APBio/pic/capillary.gif.

   Capillaries, shown in Figures 4 and 5, are thin-walled blood vessels in which gas exchange
   occurs. In the capillary, the wall is only one cell layer thick. Capillaries are concentrated
   into capillary beds. Some capillaries have small pores between the cells of the capillary wall,
   allowing materials to flow in and out of capillaries as well as the passage of white blood
   cells. Changes in blood pressure also occur in the various vessels of the circulatory system, as
   shown in Figure 6. Nutrients, wastes, and hormones are exchanged across the thin walls of
   capillaries. Capillaries are microscopic in size, although blushing is one manifestation of
   blood flow into capillaries. Control of blood flow into capillary beds is done by
   nerve-controlled sphincters.

   veins of the circulatory system. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th

   The circulatory system functions in the delivery of oxygen, nutrient molecules, and hormones and
   the removal of carbon dioxide, ammonia and other metabolic wastes. Capillaries are the points of
   exchange between the blood and surrounding tissues. Materials cross in and out of the
   capillaries by passing through or between the cells that line the capillary, as shown in Figure
   7.

   The extensive network of capillaries in the human body is estimated at between 50,000 and 60,000
   miles long. Thoroughfare channels allow blood to bypass a capillary bed. These channels can open
   and close by the action of muscles that control blood flow through the channels, as shown in
   Figure 8.

   Blood leaving the capillary beds flows into a progressively larger series of venules that in
   turn join to form veins. Veins carry blood from capillaries to the heart. With the exception of
   the pulmonary veins, blood in veins is oxygen-poor. The pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood
   from lungs back to the heart. Venules are smaller veins that gather blood from capillary beds
   into veins. Pressure in veins is low, so veins depend on nearby muscular contractions to move
   blood along. The veins have valves that prevent back-flow of blood, as shown in Figure 9.

   Figure 9. Structure of a vein (top) and the actions of muscles to propel blood through the
   veins. Images from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer

   [veinvalves.gif]

   Ventricular contraction propels blood into arteries under great pressure. Blood pressure is
   measured in mm of mercury; healthy young adults should have pressure of ventricular systole of
   120mm, and 80 mm at ventricular diastole. Higher pressures (human 120/80 as compared to a 12/1
   in lobsters) mean the volume of blood circulates faster (20 seconds in humans, 8 minutes in
   lobsters).

   As blood gets farther from the heart, the pressure likewise decreases. Each contraction of the
   ventricles sends pressure through the arteries. Elasticity of lungs helps keep pulmonary
   pressures low.

   Systemic pressure is sensed by receptors in the arteries and atria. Nerve messages from these
   sensors communicate conditions to the medulla in the brain. Signals from the medulla regulate
   blood pressure.

  Vertebrate Vascular Systems | Back to Top

   Humans, birds, and mammals have a four-chambered heart that completely separates oxygen-rich and
   oxygen-depleted blood, as is shown in Figure 10. Fish have a two-chambered heart in which a
   single-loop circulatory pattern takes blood from the heart to the gills and then to the body.
   Amphibians have a three-chambered heart with two atria and one ventricle. A loop from the heart
   goes to the pulmonary capillary beds, where gas exchange occurs. Blood then is returned to the
   heart. Blood exiting the ventricle is diverted, some to the pulmonary circuit, some to systemic
   circuit. The disadvantage of the three-chambered heart is the mixing of oxygenated and
   deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles have partial separation of the ventricle. Other reptiles,
   plus, all birds and mammals, have a four-chambered heart, with complete separation of both
   systemic and pulmonary circuits.

   four-chambered heart and pulmonary and systemic circulatory circuits. Images from Purves et al.,

  The Heart | Back to Top

   The heart, shown in Figure 11, is a muscular structure that contracts in a rhythmic pattern to
   pump blood. Hearts have a variety of forms: chambered hearts in mollusks and vertebrates,
   tubular hearts of arthropods, and aortic arches of annelids. Accessory hearts are used by
   insects to boost or supplement the main heart's actions. Fish, reptiles, and amphibians have
   lymph hearts that help pump lymph back into veins.

   The basic vertebrate heart, such as occurs in fish, has two chambers. An auricle is the chamber
   of the heart where blood is received from the body. A ventricle pumps the blood it gets through
   a valve from the auricle out to the gills through an artery.

   Amphibians have a three-chambered heart: two atria emptying into a single common ventricle. Some
   species have a partial separation of the ventricle to reduce the mixing of oxygenated (coming
   back from the lungs) and deoxygenated blood (coming in from the body). Two sided or two
   chambered hearts permit pumping at higher pressures and the addition of the pulmonary loop
   permits blood to go to the lungs at lower pressure yet still go to the systemic loop at higher
   pressures.

   Establishment of the four-chambered heart, along with the pulmonary and systemic circuits,
   completely separates oxygenated from deoxygenated blood. This allows higher the metabolic rates
   needed by warm-blooded birds and mammals.


   The human heart, as seen in Figure 11, is a two-sided, four-chambered structure with muscular
   walls. An atrioventricular (AV) valve separates each auricle from ventricle. A semilunar (also
   known as arterial) valve separates each ventricle from its connecting artery.

   The heart beats or contracts approximately 70 times per minute. The human heart will undergo
   over 3 billion contraction cycles, as shown in Figure 12, during a normal lifetime. The cardiac
   cycle consists of two parts: systole (contraction of the heart muscle) and diastole (relaxation
   of the heart muscle). Atria contract while ventricles relax. The pulse is a wave of contraction
   transmitted along the arteries. Valves in the heart open and close during the cardiac cycle.
   Heart muscle contraction is due to the presence of nodal tissue in two regions of the heart. The
   SA node (sinoatrial node) initiates heartbeat. The AV node (atrioventricular node) causes
   ventricles to contract. The AV node is sometimes called the pacemaker since it keeps heartbeat
   regular. Heartbeat is also controlled by nerve messages originating from the autonomic nervous
   system.

   Figure 12. The cardiac cycle. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th
   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with
   permission.

                                          [cardiaccycle.gif]

   Blood flows through the heart from veins to atria to ventricles out by arteries. Heart valves
   limit flow to a single direction. One heartbeat, or cardiac cycle, includes atrial contraction
   and relaxation, ventricular contraction and relaxation, and a short pause. Normal cardiac cycles
   (at rest) take 0.8 seconds. Blood from the body flows into the vena cava, which empties into the
   right atrium. At the same time, oxygenated blood from the lungs flows from the pulmonary vein
   into the left atrium. The muscles of both atria contract, forcing blood downward through each AV
   valve into each ventricle.

   Diastole is the filling of the ventricles with blood. Ventricular systole opens the SL valves,
   forcing blood out of the ventricles through the pulmonary artery or aorta. The sound of the
   heart contracting and the valves opening and closing produces a characteristic "lub-dub" sound.
   Lub is associated with closure of the AV valves, dub is the closing of the SL valves.

   Human heartbeats originate from the sinoatrial node (SA node) near the right atrium. Modified
   muscle cells contract, sending a signal to other muscle cells in the heart to contract. The
   signal spreads to the atrioventricular node (AV node). Signals carried from the AV node,
   slightly delayed, through bundle of His fibers and Purkinjie fibers cause the ventricles to
   contract simultaneously. Figure 13 illustrates several aspects of this.

   Heartbeats are coordinated contractions of heart cardiac cells, shown in an animate GIF image in
   Figure 14. When two or more of such cells are in proximity to each other their contractions
   synch up and they beat as one.

   An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures changes in electrical potential across the heart, and can
   detect the contraction pulses that pass over the surface of the heart. There are three slow,
   negative changes, known as P, R, and T as shown in Figure 15 . Positive deflections are the Q
   and S waves. The P wave represents the contraction impulse of the atria, the T wave the
   ventricular contraction. ECGs are useful in diagnosing heart abnormalities.

    Diseases of the Heart and Cardiovascular System

   Cardiac muscle cells are serviced by a system of coronary arteries. During exercise the flow
   through these arteries is up to five times normal flow. Blocked flow in coronary arteries can
   result in death of heart muscle, leading to a heart attack.

   Blockage of coronary arteries, shown in Figure 16, is usually the result of gradual buildup of
   lipids and cholesterol in the inner wall of the coronary artery. Occasional chest pain, angina
   pectoralis, can result during periods of stress or physical exertion. Angina indicates oxygen
   demands are greater than capacity to deliver it and that a heart attack may occur in the future.
   Heart muscle cells that die are not replaced since heart muscle cells do not divide. Heart
   disease and coronary artery disease are the leading causes of death in the United States.

   Hypertension, high blood pressure (the silent killer), occurs when blood pressure is
   consistently above 140/90. Causes in most cases are unknown, although stress, obesity, high salt
   intake, and smoking can add to a genetic predisposition. Luckily, when diagnosed, the condition
   is usually treatable with medicines and diet/exercise.

  The Vascular System | Back to Top

   Two main routes for circulation are the pulmonary (to and from the lungs) and the systemic (to
   and from the body). Pulmonary arteries carry blood from the heart to the lungs. In the lungs gas
   exchange occurs. Pulmonary veins carry blood from lungs to heart. The aorta is the main artery
   of systemic circuit. The vena cavae are the main veins of the systemic circuit. Coronary
   arteries deliver oxygenated blood, food, etc. to the heart. Animals often have a portal system,
   which begins and ends in capillaries, such as between the digestive tract and the liver.

   Fish pump blood from the heart to their gills, where gas exchange occurs, and then on to the
   rest of the body. Mammals pump blood to the lungs for gas exchange, then back to the heart for
   pumping out to the systemic circulation. Blood flows in only one direction.

  Blood | Back to Top

   Plasma is the liquid component of the blood. Mammalian blood consists of a liquid (plasma) and a
   number of cellular and cell fragment components as shown in Figure 21. Plasma is about 60 % of a
   volume of blood; cells and fragments are 40%. Plasma has 90% water and 10% dissolved materials
   including proteins, glucose, ions, hormones, and gases. It acts as a buffer, maintaining pH near
   7.4. Plasma contains nutrients, wastes, salts, proteins, etc. Proteins in the blood aid in
   transport of large molecules such as cholesterol.

   Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, are flattened, doubly concave cells about 7 µm in
   diameter that carry oxygen associated in the cell's hemoglobin. Mature erythrocytes lack a
   nucleus. They are small, 4 to 6 million cells per cubic millimeter of blood, and have 200
   million hemoglobin molecules per cell. Humans have a total of 25 trillion red blood cells (about
   1/3 of all the cells in the body). Red blood cells are continuously manufactured in red marrow
   of long bones, ribs, skull, and vertebrae. Life-span of an erythrocyte is only 120 days, after
   which they are destroyed in liver and spleen. Iron from hemoglobin is recovered and reused by
   red marrow. The liver degrades the heme units and secretes them as pigment in the bile,
   responsible for the color of feces. Each second two million red blood cells are produced to
   replace those thus taken out of circulation.

   White blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are larger than erythrocytes, have a nucleus, and
   lack hemoglobin. They function in the cellular immune response. White blood cells (leukocytes)
   are less than 1% of the blood's volume. They are made from stem cells in bone marrow. There are
   five types of leukocytes, important components of the immune system. Neutrophils enter the
   tissue fluid by squeezing through capillary walls and phagocytozing foreign substances.
   Macrophages release white blood cell growth factors, causing a population increase for white
   blood cells. Lymphocytes fight infection. T-cells attack cells containing viruses. B-cells
   produce antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes are phagocytized by a macrophage. White blood
   cells can squeeze through pores in the capillaries and fight infectious diseases in interstitial
   areas

   Platelets result from cell fragmentation and are involved with clotting, as is shown by Figures
   17 and 18. Platelets are cell fragments that bud off megakaryocytes in bone marrow. They carry
   chemicals essential to blood clotting. Platelets survive for 10 days before being removed by the
   liver and spleen. There are 150,000 to 300,000 platelets in each milliliter of blood. Platelets
   stick and adhere to tears in blood vessels; they also release clotting factors. A hemophiliac's
   blood cannot clot. Providing correct proteins (clotting factors) has been a common method of
   treating hemophiliacs. It has also led to HIV transmission due to the use of transfusions and
   use of contaminated blood products.

  The Lymphatic System | Back to Top

   Water and plasma are forced from the capillaries into intracellular spaces. This interstitial
   fluid transports materials between cells. Most of this fluid is collected in the capillaries of
   a secondary circulatory system, the lymphatic system. Fluid in this system is known as lymph.

   Lymph flows from small lymph capillaries into lymph vessels that are similar to veins in having
   valves that prevent backflow. Lymph vessels connect to lymph nodes, lymph organs, or to the
   cardiovascular system at the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct.

   Lymph nodes are small irregularly shaped masses through which lymph vessels flow. Clusters of
   nodes occur in the armpits, groin, and neck. Cells of the immune system line channels through
   the nodes and attack bacteria and viruses traveling in the lymph.
