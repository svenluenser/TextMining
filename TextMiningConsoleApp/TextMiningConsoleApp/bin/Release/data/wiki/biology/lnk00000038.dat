What is Photosynthesis? | Back to Top

   Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some bacteria, and some protistans use the energy
   from sunlight to produce sugar, which cellular respiration converts into ATP, the "fuel" used by
   all living things. The conversion of unusable sunlight energy into usable chemical energy, is
   associated with the actions of the green pigment chlorophyll. Most of the time, the
   photosynthetic process uses water and releases the oxygen that we absolutely must have to stay
   alive. Oh yes, we need the food as well!

   We can write the overall reaction of this process as:

                           6H[2]O + 6CO[2] ----------> C[6]H[12]O[6]+ 6O[2]

   Most of us don't speak chemicalese, so the above chemical equation translates as:

   six molecules of water plus six molecules of carbon dioxide produce one molecule of sugar plus
   six molecules of oxygen

Leaves and Leaf Structure | Back to Top

   Plants are the only photosynthetic organisms to have leaves (and not all plants have leaves). A
   leaf may be viewed as a solar collector crammed full of photosynthetic cells.

   The raw materials of photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide, enter the cells of the leaf, and
   the products of photosynthesis, sugar and oxygen, leave the leaf.

                                            [leafstru.gif]

   Water enters the root and is transported up to the leaves through specialized plant cells known
   as xylem (pronounces zigh-lem). Land plants must guard against drying out (desiccation) and so
   have evolved specialized structures known as stomata to allow gas to enter and leave the leaf.
   Carbon dioxide cannot pass through the protective waxy layer covering the leaf (cuticle), but it
   can enter the leaf through an opening (the stoma; plural = stomata; Greek for hole) flanked by
   two guard cells. Likewise, oxygen produced during photosynthesis can only pass out of the leaf
   through the opened stomata. Unfortunately for the plant, while these gases are moving between
   the inside and outside of the leaf, a great deal water is also lost. Cottonwood trees, for
   example, will lose 100 gallons of water per hour during hot desert days. Carbon dioxide enters
   single-celled and aquatic autotrophs through no specialized structures.

  The Nature of Light | Back to Top

   White light is separated into the different colors (=wavelengths) of light by passing it through
   a prism. Wavelength is defined as the distance from peak to peak (or trough to trough). The
   energy of is inversely porportional to the wavelength: longer wavelengths have less energy than
   do shorter ones.

                                           [wavelength.gif]

   Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   The order of colors is determined by the wavelength of light. Visible light is one small part of
   the electromagnetic spectrum. The longer the wavelength of visible light, the more red the
   color. Likewise the shorter wavelengths are towards the violet side of the spectrum. Wavelengths
   longer than red are referred to as infrared, while those shorter than violet are ultraviolet.

                                            [spectrum.gif]

   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with
   permission.

   Light behaves both as a wave and a particle. Wave properties of light include the bending of the
   wave path when passing from one material (medium) into another (i.e. the prism, rainbows, pencil
   in a glass-of-water, etc.). The particle properties are demonstrated by the photoelectric
   effect. Zinc exposed to ultraviolet light becomes positively charged because light energy forces
   electrons from the zinc. These electrons can create an electrical current. Sodium, potassium and
   selenium have critical wavelengths in the visible light range. The critical wavelength is the
   maximum wavelength of light (visible or invisible) that creates a photoelectric effect.

Chlorophyll and Accessory Pigments | Back to Top

   A pigment is any substance that absorbs light. The color of the pigment comes from the
   wavelengths of light reflected (in other words, those not absorbed). Chlorophyll, the green
   pigment common to all photosynthetic cells, absorbs all wavelengths of visible light except
   green, which it reflects to be detected by our eyes. Black pigments absorb all of the
   wavelengths that strike them. White pigments/lighter colors reflect all or almost all of the
   energy striking them. Pigments have their own characteristic absorption spectra, the absorption
   pattern of a given pigment.

                                             [colors.gif]

   Chlorophyll is a complex molecule. Several modifications of chlorophyll occur among plants and
   other photosynthetic organisms. All photosynthetic organisms (plants, certain protistans,
   prochlorobacteria, and cyanobacteria) have chlorophyll a. Accessory pigments absorb energy that
   chlorophyll a does not absorb. Accessory pigments include chlorophyll b (also c, d, and e in
   algae and protistans), xanthophylls, and carotenoids (such as beta-carotene). Chlorophyll a
   absorbs its energy from the Violet-Blue and Reddish orange-Red wavelengths, and little from the
   intermediate (Green-Yellow-Orange) wavelengths.

                                          [chlorophyll.gif]

   Molecular model of carotene. The above image is from
   http://www.nyu.edu:80/pages/mathmol/library/photo.

   Carotenoids and chlorophyll b absorb some of the energy in the green wavelength. Why not so much
   in the orange and yellow wavelengths? Both chlorophylls also absorb in the orange-red end of the
   spectrum (with longer wavelengths and lower energy). The origins of photosynthetic organisms in
   the sea may account for this. Shorter wavelengths (with more energy) do not penetrate much below
   5 meters deep in sea water. The ability to absorb some energy from the longer (hence more
   penetrating) wavelengths might have been an advantage to early photosynthetic algae that were
   not able to be in the upper (photic) zone of the sea all the time.

   The action spectrum of photosynthesis is the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths of
   light at generating electrons. If a pigment absorbs light energy, one of three things will
   occur. Energy is dissipated as heat. The energy may be emitted immediately as a longer
   wavelength, a phenomenon known as fluorescence. Energy may trigger a chemical reaction, as in
   photosynthesis. Chlorophyll only triggers a chemical reaction when it is associated with
   proteins embedded in a membrane (as in a chloroplast) or the membrane infoldings found in
   photosynthetic prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria and prochlorobacteria.

The structure of the chloroplast and photosynthetic membranes | Back to Top

   The thylakoid is the structural unit of photosynthesis. Both photosynthetic prokaryotes and
   eukaryotes have these flattened sacs/vesicles containing photosynthetic chemicals. Only
   eukaryotes have chloroplasts with a surrounding membrane.

   Thylakoids are stacked like pancakes in stacks known collectively as grana. The areas between
   grana are referred to as stroma. While the mitochondrion has two membrane systems, the
   chloroplast has three, forming three compartments.

Stages of Photosynthesis | Back to Top

   Photosynthesis is a two stage process. The first process is the Light Dependent Process (Light
   Reactions), requires the direct energy of light to make energy carrier molecules that are used
   in the second process. The Light Independent Process (or Dark Reactions) occurs when the
   products of the Light Reaction are used to form C-C covalent bonds of carbohydrates. The Dark
   Reactions can usually occur in the dark, if the energy carriers from the light process are
   present. Recent evidence suggests that a major enzyme of the Dark Reaction is indirectly
   stimulated by light, thus the term Dark Reaction is somewhat of a misnomer. The Light Reactions
   occur in the grana and the Dark Reactions take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts.

                                           [psoverview.gif]

  Light Reactions | Back to Top

   In the Light Dependent Processes (Light Reactions) light strikes chlorophyll a in such a way as
   to excite electrons to a higher energy state. In a series of reactions the energy is converted
   (along an electron transport process) into ATP and NADPH. Water is split in the process,
   releasing oxygen as a by-product of the reaction. The ATP and NADPH are used to make C-C bonds
   in the Light Independent Process (Dark Reactions).

   In the Light Independent Process, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or water for
   aquatic/marine organisms) is captured and modified by the addition of Hydrogen to form
   carbohydrates (general formula of carbohydrates is [CH[2]O][n]). The incorporation of carbon
   dioxide into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The energy for this comes from the
   first phase of the photosynthetic process. Living systems cannot directly utilize light energy,
   but can, through a complicated series of reactions, convert it into C-C bond energy that can be
   released by glycolysis and other metabolic processes.

   Photosystems are arrangements of chlorophyll and other pigments packed into thylakoids. Many
   Prokaryotes have only one photosystem, Photosystem II (so numbered because, while it was most
   likely the first to evolve, it was the second one discovered). Eukaryotes have Photosystem II
   plus Photosystem I. Photosystem I uses chlorophyll a, in the form referred to as P700.
   Photosystem II uses a form of chlorophyll a known as P680. Both "active" forms of chlorophyll a
   function in photosynthesis due to their association with proteins in the thylakoid membrane.

                                             [photo.gif]

   Action of a photosystem. This image is from the University of Minnesota page at
   http://genbiol.cbs.umn.edu/Multimedia/examples.html.

   Photophosphorylation is the process of converting energy from a light-excited electron into the
   pyrophosphate bond of an ADP molecule. This occurs when the electrons from water are excited by
   the light in the presence of P680. The energy transfer is similar to the chemiosmotic electron
   transport occurring in the mitochondria. Light energy causes the removal of an electron from a
   molecule of P680 that is part of Photosystem II. The P680 requires an electron, which is taken
   from a water molecule, breaking the water into H^+ ions and O^-2 ions. These O^-2 ions combine
   to form the diatomic O[2] that is released. The electron is "boosted" to a higher energy state
   and attached to a primary electron acceptor, which begins a series of redox reactions, passing
   the electron through a series of electron carriers, eventually attaching it to a molecule in
   Photosystem I. Light acts on a molecule of P700 in Photosystem I, causing an electron to be
   "boosted" to a still higher potential. The electron is attached to a different primary electron
   acceptor (that is a different molecule from the one associated with Photosystem II). The
   electron is passed again through a series of redox reactions, eventually being attached to
   NADP^+ and H^+ to form NADPH, an energy carrier needed in the Light Independent Reaction. The
   electron from Photosystem II replaces the excited electron in the P700 molecule. There is thus a
   continuous flow of electrons from water to NADPH. This energy is used in Carbon Fixation. Cyclic
   Electron Flow occurs in some eukaryotes and primitive photosynthetic bacteria. No NADPH is
   produced, only ATP. This occurs when cells may require additional ATP, or when there is no
   NADP^+ to reduce to NADPH. In Photosystem II, the pumping to H ions into the thylakoid and the
   conversion of ADP + P into ATP is driven by electron gradients established in the thylakoid
   membrane.

   The above diagrams present the "old" view of photophosphorylation. We now know where the process
   occurs in the chloroplast, and can link that to chemiosmotic synthesis of ATP.

   Halobacteria, which grow in extremely salty water, are facultative aerobes, they can grow when
   oxygen is absent. Purple pigments, known as retinal (a pigment also found in the human eye) act
   similar to chlorophyll. The complex of retinal and membrane proteins is known as
   bacteriorhodopsin, which generates electrons which establish a proton gradient that powers an
   ADP-ATP pump, generating ATP from sunlight without chlorophyll. This supports the theory that
   chemiosmotic processes are universal in their ability to generate ATP.

  Dark Reaction | Back to Top

   Carbon-Fixing Reactions are also known as the Dark Reactions (or Light Independent Reactions).
   Carbon dioxide enters single-celled and aquatic autotrophs through no specialized structures,
   diffusing into the cells. Land plants must guard against drying out (desiccation) and so have
   evolved specialized structures known as stomata to allow gas to enter and leave the leaf. The
   Calvin Cycle occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts (where would it occur in a prokaryote?).
   Carbon dioxide is captured by the chemical ribulose biphosphate (RuBP). RuBP is a 5-C chemical.
   Six molecules of carbon dioxide enter the Calvin Cycle, eventually producing one molecule of
   glucose. The reactions in this process were worked out by Melvin Calvin (shown below).

                                            [MCalvin.jpeg]

   http://www-itg.lbl.gov/ImgLib/COLLECTIONS/BERKELEY-LAB/PEOPLE/INDIVIDUALS/index/BIOCHEM_523.html
   , Ernest OrlandoLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. " One of the new areas, cultivated both
   in Donner and the Old Radiation Laboratory, was the study of organic compounds labeled with
   carbon-14. Melvin Calvin took charge of this work at the end of the war in order to provide raw
   materials for John Lawrence's researches and for his own study of photosynthesis. Using
   carbon-14, available in plenty from Hanford reactors, and the new techniques of ion exchange,
   paper chromatography, and radioautography, Calvin and his many associates mapped the complete
   path of carbon in photosynthesis. The accomplishment brought him the Nobel prize in chemistry in
   1961. (The preceding information was excerpted from the text of the Fall 1981 issue of LBL
   Newsmagazine.) Citation Caption: LBL News, Vol.6, No.3, Fall 1981 Melvin Calvin shown with some
   of the apparatus he used to study the role of carbon in photosynthesis."

   The first stable product of the Calvin Cycle is phosphoglycerate (PGA), a 3-C chemical. The
   energy from ATP and NADPH energy carriers generated by the photosystems is used to attach
   phosphates to (phosphorylate) the PGA. Eventually there are 12 molecules of glyceraldehyde
   phosphate (also known as phosphoglyceraldehyde or PGAL, a 3-C), two of which are removed from
   the cycle to make a glucose. The remaining PGAL molecules are converted by ATP energy to reform
   6 RuBP molecules, and thus start the cycle again. Remember the complexity of life, each reaction
   in this process, as in Kreb's Cycle, is catalyzed by a different reaction-specific enzyme.

C-4 Pathway | Back to Top

   Some plants have developed a preliminary step to the Calvin Cycle (which is also referred to as
   a C-3 pathway), this preamble step is known as C-4. While most C-fixation begins with RuBP, C-4
   begins with a new molecule, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a 3-C chemical that is converted into
   oxaloacetic acid (OAA, a 4-C chemical) when carbon dioxide is combined with PEP. The OAA is
   converted to Malic Acid and then transported from the mesophyll cell into the bundle-sheath
   cell, where OAA is broken down into PEP plus carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide then enters the
   Calvin Cycle, with PEP returning to the mesophyll cell. The resulting sugars are now adjacent to
   the leaf veins and can readily be transported throughout the plant.

                                             [C4phot.gif]

   C-4 photosynthsis involves the separation of carbon fixation and carbohydrate systhesis in space
   and time. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer
   Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

   The capture of carbon dioxide by PEP is mediated by the enzyme PEP carboxylase, which has a
   stronger affinity for carbon dioxide than does RuBP carboxylase When carbon dioxide levels
   decline below the threshold for RuBP carboxylase, RuBP is catalyzed with oxygen instead of
   carbon dioxide. The product of that reaction forms glycolic acid, a chemical that can be broken
   down by photorespiration, producing neither NADH nor ATP, in effect dismantling the Calvin
   Cycle. C-4 plants, which often grow close together, have had to adjust to decreased levels of
   carbon dioxide by artificially raising the carbon dioxide concentration in certain cells to
   prevent photorespiration. C-4 plants evolved in the tropics and are adapted to higher
   temperatures than are the C-3 plants found at higher latitudes. Common C-4 plants include
   crabgrass, corn, and sugar cane. Note that OAA and Malic Acid also have functions in other
   processes, thus the chemicals would have been present in all plants, leading scientists to
   hypothesize that C-4 mechanisms evolved several times independently in response to a similar
   environmental condition, a type of evolution known as convergent evolution.

The Carbon Cycle | Back to Top

   Plants may be viewed as carbon sinks, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and oceans by
   fixing it into organic chemicals. Plants also produce some carbon dioxide by their respiration,
   but this is quickly used by photosynthesis. Plants also convert energy from light into chemical
   energy of C-C covalent bonds. Animals are carbon dioxide producers that derive their energy from
   carbohydrates and other chemicals produced by plants by the process of photosynthesis.

   The balance between the plant carbon dioxide removal and animal carbon dioxide generation is
   equalized also by the formation of carbonates in the oceans. This removes excess carbon dioxide
   from the air and water (both of which are in equilibrium with regard to carbon dioxide). Fossil
   fuels, such as petroleum and coal, as well as more recent fuels such as peat and wood generate
   carbon dioxide when burned. Fossil fuels are formed ultimately by organic processes, and
   represent also a tremendous carbon sink. Human activity has greatly increased the concentration
   of carbon dioxide in air. This increase has led to global warming, an increase in temperatures
   around the world, the Greenhouse Effect. The increase in carbon dioxide and other pollutants in
   the air has also led to acid rain, where water falls through polluted air and chemically
   combines with carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, and sulfur oxides, producing rainfall with pH as
   low as 4. This results in fish kills and changes in soil pH which can alter the natural
   vegetation and uses of the land. The Global Warming problem can lead to melting of the ice caps
   in Greenland and Antarctica, raising sea-level as much as 120 meters. Changes in sea-level and
   temperature would affect climate changes, altering belts of grain production and rainfall
   patterns.
