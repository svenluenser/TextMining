   We are all familiar with many of the organ systems that comprise the body of advanced animals:
   such as the circulatory system, nervous system, etc. More of us are aware of the essential
   nature of the immune system in these days of HIV, AIDS, and emergent viral diseases such as
   Ebola and Hanta. Later chapters will focus on animals, such as sponges that have no organs at
   all, and other organisms that lack many of the organ systems we take for granted. Recall that in
   the Introduction chapter we discussed the levels of organization we see in biology, from atoms
   to organ systems that makeup a multicellular organism. We have also seen somewhat of the myriad
   cells and tissues that occur in humans (and by extension in other animals). This chapter will
   introduce you to the eleven organ systems that function within our own bodies, and how they
   coordinate to keep us functioning within a dynamic range of internal conditions we refer to as
   homeostasis.

   Animal organs are usually composed of more than one cell type. Recall that the stomach contains
   all four animal tissue types: epithelium to line the stomach and secrete gastric juices;
   connective tissues to give the stomach flexibility to expand after a large meal; smooth muscle
   tissues to churn and digest that meal without the need for conscious thought (indeed, we are
   aware of that action only when we burp or suffer some sort of gastric distress!); and nervous
   tissues to monitor the progress of food as it is worked on by the stomach, and to direct
   secretion and muscle activity. Each organ typically performs a given function set. The stomach
   is an organ composed of tissues that aid in the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food. Most
   organs have functions in only one organ system. The stomach is involved only in the digestion of
   food as part of the digestive system. Organ systems, such as the digestive system, are
   collections of organs that perform a major function for the organism.

  Homeostasis | Back to Top

   Homeostasis is the maintenance of a stable internal environment. Homeostasis is a term coined in
   1959 to describe the physical and chemical parameters that an organism must maintain to allow
   proper functioning of its component cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.

   Recall that enzymes function best when within a certain range of temperature and pH, and that
   cells must strive to maintain a balance between having too much or too little water in relation
   to their external environment. Both situations demonstrate homeostasis. Just as we have a
   certain temperature range (or comfort zone), so our body has a range of environmental (internal
   as well as external) parameters within which it works best.  Multicellular organisms accomplish
   this by having organs and organ systems that coordinate their homeostasis. In addition to the
   other functions that life must perform (recall the discussion in our Introduction chapter),
   unicellular creatures must accomplish their homeostasis within but a single cell!

   Single-celled organisms are surrounded by their external environment. They move materials into
   and out of the cell by regulation of the cell membrane and its functioning. Most multicellular
   organisms have most of their cells protected from the external environment, having them
   surrounded by an aqueous internal environment. This internal environment must be maintained in
   such a state as to allow maximum efficiency. The ultimate control of homeostasis is done by the
   nervous system. Often this control is in the form of negative feedback loops. Heat control is a
   major function of homeostatic conditions that involves the integration of skin, muscular,
   nervous, and circulatory systems.

   The difference between homeostasis as a single cell performs it and what a multicelled creature
   does derives from their basic organizational plan: a single cell can dump wastes outside the
   cell and just be done with it. Cells in a multicelled creature, such as a human or cat, also
   dump wastes outside those cells, but like the trash can or dumpster outside my house/apartment,
   those wastes must be carted away. The carting away of these wastes is accomplished in my body by
   the circulatory system in conjunction with the excretory system. For my house, I have the City
   of Phoenix sanitation department do that (and get to pay each month for their service!).

   The ultimate control of homeostasis is accomplished by the nervous system (for rapid responses
   such as reflexes to avoid picking up a hot pot off the stove) and the endocrine system (for
   longer-term responses, such as maintaining the body levels of calcium, etc.). Often this
   homeostatic control takes the form of negative feedback loops. There are two types of biological
   feedback: positive and negative. Negative feedback turns off the stimulus that caused it in the
   first place. Your houseâ€™s heater (or cooler for those of us in the Sun Belt) acts on the
   principle of negative feedback. When your house cools off below the temperature set by your
   thermostat, the heater is turned on to warm air until the temperature is at or above what the
   thermostat is set at. The thermostat detects this rise in temperature and sends a signal to shut
   off the heater, allowing the house to cool of until the heater is turned on yet again and the
   cycle (or loop) continues. Positive feedback causes an amplification of the stimulus by the
   reaction. Examples of each will be presented below.

  The Internal Environment | Back to Top

   There are two types of extracellular fluids in animals:
     * the extracellular fluid that surrounds and bathes cells
     * plasma, the liquid component of the blood.

   Internal components of homeostasis:
    1. Concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide
    2. pH of the internal environment
    3. Concentration of nutrients and waste products
    4. Concentration of salt and other electrolytes
    5. Volume and pressure of extracellular fluid

  Control Systems | Back to Top

   Open systems are linear and have no feedback, such as a light switch. Closed Systems has two
   components: a sensor and an effector, such as a thermostat (sensor) and furnace (effector). Most
   physiological systems in the body use feedback to maintain the body's internal environment.

    Extrinsic

   Most homeostatic systems are extrinsic: they are controlled from outside the body. Endocrine and
   nervous systems are the major control systems in higher animals.

   The nervous system depends on sensors in the skin or sensory organs to receive stimuli and
   transmit a message to the spinal cord or brain. Sensory input is processed and a signal is sent
   to an effector system, such as muscles or glands, that effects the response to the stimulus.

   The endocrine system is the second type of extrinsic control, and involves a chemical component
   to the reflex. Sensors detect a change within the body and send a message to an endocrine
   effector (parathyroid), which makes PTH. PTH is released into the blood when blood calcium
   levels are low. PTH causes bone to release calcium into the bloodstream, raising the blood
   calcium levels and shutting down the production of PTH.

   Some reflexes have a combination of nervous and endocrine response. The thyroid gland secretes
   thyroxin (which controls the metabolic rate) into the bloodstream. Falling levels of thyroxin
   stimulate receptors in the brain to signal the hypothalamus to release a hormone that acts on
   the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) into the blood. TSH acts on the
   thyroid, causing it to increase production of thyroxin.

    Intrinsic

   Local, or intrinsic, controls usually involve only one organ or tissue. When muscles use more
   oxygen, and also produce more carbon dioxide, intrinsic controls cause dilation of the blood
   vessels allowing more blood into those active areas of the muscles. Eventually the vessels will
   return to "normal".

  Feedback Systems in Homeostasis | Back to Top

   Negative feedback control mechanisms (used by most of the body's systems) are called negative
   because the information caused by the feedback causes a reverse of the response. TSH is an
   example: blood levels of TSH serve as feedback for production of TSH.

   Positive feedback control is used in some cases. Input increases or accelerates the response.
   During uterine contractions, oxytocin is produced. Oxytocin causes an increase in frequency and
   strength of uterine contractions. This in turn causes further production of oxytocin, etc.

   Homeostasis depends on the action and interaction of a number of body systems to maintain a
   range of conditions within which the body can best operate.

  Body Systems and Homeostasis | Back to Top

   Eleven major organ systems are present within animals, although some animals lack one or more of
   them. The vertebrate body has two cavities: the thoracic, which contains the heart and lungs;
   and the abdominal, which contains digestive organs. The head, or cephalic region, contains four
   of the five senses as well as a brain encased in the bony skull. These organ systems can be
   grouped according to their functions.

                                           [SKSKELMUS.gif]

     * Muscular System (shown in Figure 1) facilitates movement and locomotion. The muscular system
       produces body movements, body heat, maintains posture, and supports the body. Muscle fibers
       are the main cell type. Action of this system is closely tied to that of the skeletal
       system.
     * Skeletal System (shown in Figure 1) provides support and protection, and attachment points
       for muscles. The skeletal system provides rigid framework for movement. It supports and
       protects the body and body parts, produces blood cells, and stores minerals.
     * Skin or Integument (shown in Figure 1) is the outermost protective layer. It prevents water
       loss from and invasion of foreign microorganisms and viruses into the body. There are three
       layers of the skin. The epidermis is the outer, thinner layer of skin. Basal cells
       continually undergo mitosis. Skin is waterproof because keratin, a protein is produced. The
       next layer is the dermis a layer of fibrous connective tissue. Within the dermis many
       structures are located, such as sweat glands, hair follicles and oil glands. The
       subcutaneous layer is composed of loose connective tissue. Adipose tissue occurs here,
       serving primarily for insulation. Nerve cells run through this region, as do arteries and
       veins.

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                          [dige%3Aexch.gif]

     * Respiratory System moves oxygen from the external environment into the internal environment;
       also removes carbon dioxide. The respiratory system exchanges gas between lungs (gills in
       fish) and the outside environment. It also maintains pH of the blood and facilitates
       exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. The system is summarized in Figure 2.
     * Digestive System digests and absorbs food into nutrient molecules by chemical and mechanical
       breakdown; eliminates solid wastes into the environment. Digestion is accomplished by
       mechanical and chemical means,breaking food into particles small enough to pass into
       bloodstream. Absorbtion of food molecules occurs in the small intestine and sends them into
       circulatory system. The digestive system also recycles water and reclaims vitamins from food
       in the large intestine. The system is summarized in Figure 2.

   Figure 3. The circulatory and lymphatic systems. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of
   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman
   (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.

                                          [circ%3Alymph.gif]

     * Circulatory System (Figure 3) transports oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, waste products,
       immune components, and hormones. Major organs include the heart, capillaries, arteries, and
       veins. The lymphatic system also transports excess fluids to and from circulatory system and
       transports fat to the heart.
     * Immune System (Lymphatic system, Figure 3) defends the internal environment from invading
       microorganisms and viruses, as well as cancerous cell growth. The immune system provides
       cells that aid in protection of the body from disease via the antigen/antibody response. A
       variety of general responses are also part of this system.

   Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with

                                             [urisys.gif]

     * Excretory System regulates volume of internal body fluids as well as eliminates metabolic
       wastes from the internal environment. The excretory system removes organic wastes from the
       blood, accumulating wastes as urea in the kidneys. These wastes are then removed as urine.
       this system is also responsible for maintaining fluid levels.

   Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman

                                            [nervendo.gif]

     * Nervous System, illustrated in Figure 5, coordinates and controls actions of internal organs
       and body systems. Memory, learning, and conscious thought are a few aspects of the functions
       of the nervous system. Maintaining autonomic functions such as heartbeat, breathing, control
       of involuntary muscle actions are performed by some of the parts of this system.
     * Endocrine System, illustrated in Figure 5, works with the nervous system to control the
       activity internal organs as well as coordinating long-range response to external stimuli.
       The endocrine system secretes hormones that regulate body metabolism, growth, and
       reproduction. These organs are not in contact with each other, although they communicate by
       chemical messages dumped into the circulatory system.

   [femalerepro_1.gif]

     * Reproductive System, shown in Figure 6, is mostly controlled by the endocrine system, and is
       responsible for survival and perpetuation of the species. Elements of the reproductive
       system produce hormones (from endocrine control) that control and aid in sexual development.
       Organs of this system produce gametes that combine in the female system to produce the next
       generation (embryo).
