  The human karyotype | Back to Top

   There are 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes in the human genome, for a total of 46. Karyotypes
   are pictures of homologous chromosomes lined up together during Metaphase I of meiosis. The
   chromosome micrographs are then arranged by size and pasted onto a sheet.

  Human chromosomal abnormalities | Back to Top

   A common abnormality is caused by nondisjunction, the failure of replicated chromosomes to
   segregate during Anaphase II. A gamete lacking a chromosome cannot produce a viable embryo.
   Occasionally a gamete with n+1 chromosomes can produce a viable embryo.

   In humans, nondisjunction is most often associated with the 21st chromosome, producing a disease
   known as Down's syndrome (also referred to as trisomy 21). Sufferers of Down's syndrome suffer
   mild to severe mental retardation, short stocky body type, large tongue leading to speech
   difficulties, and (in those who survive into middle-age), a propensity to develop Alzheimer's
   Disease. Ninety-five percent of Down's cases result from nondisjunction of chromosome 21.
   Occasional cases result from a translocation in the chromosomes of one parent. Remember that a
   translocation occurs when one chromosome (or a fragment) is transferred to a non-homologous
   chromosome. The incidence of Down's Syndrome increases with age of the mother, although 25% of
   the cases result from an extra chromosome from the father. Click here to view a drawing (from
   Bioweb) of a karyotype of Down's syndrome.

   Sex-chromosome abnormalities may also be caused by nondisjunction of one or more sex
   chromosomes. Any combination (up to XXXXY) produces maleness. Males with more than one X are
   usually underdeveloped and sterile. XXX and XO women are known, although in most cases they are
   sterile. What meiotic difficulties might a person with Down's syndrome or extra sex-chromosomes
   face?

   Kleinfelter's syndrome (click here to view a karyotype from Bioweb) How does this differ from
   the normal karyotype?

   Turner's syndrome (click here to view a karyotype from Bioweb) How does this differ from the
   normal karyotype?

   Chromosome deletions may also be associated with other syndromes such as Wilm's tumor.

   Prenatal detection of chromosomal abnormalities is accomplished chiefly by amniocentesis. A thin
   needle is inserted into the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus (a term applied to an unborn
   baby after the first trimester). Cells are withdrawn have been sloughed off by the fetus, yet
   they are still fetal cells and can be used to determine the state of the fetal chromosomes, such
   as Down's Syndrome and the sex of the baby after a karyotype has been made.

  Human Allelic Disorders (Recessive) | Back to Top

   The first Mendelian trait in humans was described in 1905 (brachydactly) by Dr. Farabee (no
   relation to your author). Now more than 3500 human genetic traits are known.

   Albinism, the lack of pigmentation in skin, hair, and eyes, is also a Mendelian human trait.
   Homozygous recessive (aa) individuals make no pigments, and so have face, hair, and eyes that
   are white to yellow. For heterozygous parents with normal pigmentation (Aa), two different types
   of gametes may be produced: A or a. From such a cross 1/4 of the children could be albinos. The
   brown pigment melanin cannot be made by albinos. Several mutations may cause albinism: 1) the
   lack of one or another enzyme along the melanin-producing pathway; or 2) the inability of the
   enzyme to enter the pigment cells and convert the amino acid tyrosine into melanin.

   Phenylketonuria (PKU) is recessively inherited disorder whose sufferers lack the ability to
   synthesize an enzyme to convert the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine Individuals
   homozygous recessive for this allele have a buildup of phenylalanine and abnormal breakdown
   products in the urine and blood. The breakdown products can be harmful to developing nervous
   systems and lead to mental retardation. 1 in 15,000 infants suffers from this problem. PKU
   homozygotes are now routinely tested for in most states. If you look closely at a product
   containing Nutra-sweet artificial sweetener, you will see a warning to PKU sufferers since
   phenylalanine is one of the amino acids in the sweetener. PKU sufferers are placed on a diet low
   in phenylalanine, enough for metabolic needs but not enough to cause the buildup of harmful
   intermediates.

   Tay-Sachs Disease is an autosomal recessive resulting in degeneration of the nervous system.
   Symptoms manifest after birth. Children homozygous recessive for this allele rarely survive past
   five years of age. Sufferers lack the ability to make the enzyme N-acetyl-hexosaminidase, which
   breaks down the GM2 ganglioside lipid. This lipid accumulates in lysosomes in brain cells,
   eventually killing the brain cells. Although rare in the general population (1 in 300,000
   births), it was (until recently) higher (1 in 3600 births) among Jews of eastern central
   European descent. One in 28 American Jews is thought to be a carrier, since 90% of the American
   Jewish population emigrated from those areas in Europe. Most Tay-Sachs babies born in the US are
   born to non-Jewish parents, who did not undergo testing programs that most US Jewish prospective
   parents had.

   Sickle-cell anemia is an autosomal recessive we have discussed in other sections. Nine-percent
   of US blacks are heterozygous, while 0.2% are homozygous recessive. The recessive allele causes
   a single amino acid substitution in the beta chains of hemoglobin. When oxygen concentration is
   low, sickling of cells occurs. Heterozygotes make enough "good beta-chain hemoglobin" that they
   do not suffer as long as oxygen concentrations remain high, such as at sea-level.

  Human Allelic Disorders (Dominant) | Back to Top

   Autosomal dominants are rare, although they are (by definition) more commonly expressed.

   Achondroplastic dwarfism occurs, even though sufferers have reduced fertility.

   Huntington's disease (also referred to as Woody Guthrie's disease, after the folk singer who
   died in the 1960s) is an autosomal dominant resulting in progressive destruction of brain cells.
   If a parent has the disease, 50% of the children will have it (unless that parent was homozygous
   dominant, in which case all children would have the disease). The disease usually does not
   manifest until after age 30, although some instances of early onset phenomenon are reported
   among individuals in their twenties.

   Polydactly is the presence of a sixth digit. In modern times the extra finger has been cut off
   at birth and individuals do not know they carry this trait. One of the wives of Henry VIII had
   an extra finger. In certain southern families the trait is also more common. The extra digit is
   rarely functional and definitely causes problems buying gloves, let alone fitting them on during
   a murder trial.

  Sex-linked Traits | Back to Top

   Color blindness afflicts 8% of males and 0.04 % of human females. Color perception depends on
   three genes, each producing chemicals sensitive to different parts of the visible light
   spectrum. Red and green detecting genes are on the X-chromosome, while the blue detection is on
   an autosome.

   Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors in blood are
   involved in clotting. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A,
   the most common form. Normal Factor VIII can be supplied at a high dollar and health risk cost,
   although the development of biotechnologically engineered Factor VIII produced by bacteria
   lessens the health risk. England's Queen Victoria was a carrier for this disease. The allele was
   passed to two of her daughters and one son. Since royal families in Europe commonly
   intermarried, the allele spread, and may have contributed to the downfall of the Russian
   monarchy (Czar Nicholas' son Alexei suffered from hemophilia A inherited from his mother who
   carried Victoria's genetic secret).

   Muscular dystrophy is a term encompassing a variety of muscle wasting diseases. The most common
   type, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), affects cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as some
   mental functions. DMD is an X-linked recessive occurring in 1 in 3500 newborns. Most sufferers
   die before their 20th birthday. In 1987, Louis Kunkel claimed to have isolated a protein,
   dystrophin, present in normal individuals (about 0.002 % of their muscle protein) but absent in
   two individuals with DMD. The lack of dystrophin is accompanied with a condition of muscle
   hardening known as fibrosis, which restricts blood supply to the muscle which then die. The gene
   technologies discussed in an earlier chapter have been employed to sequence and clone the
   dystrophin gene, which is the largest known human gene (some 2-3 million base pairs), with 60
   exons and many large introns.

  Diagnosis of Human Genetic Diseases | Back to Top

   Restriction enzymes, such as Hpa I were used in a study on sickle-cell anemia. The probe
   hybridized in normal hemoglobin with two fragments 7000 or 7600 nucleotides long. Sickle-cell
   hemoglobin had hybridization with a 13,000 nucleotide single sequence. A similar result has been
   obtained from amniocentesis studies, providing a tool to screen fetus and adult for sickle-cell.
   The markers where hybridization occurred are referred to as RFLPs (restriction-fragment-length
   polymorphisms). The longer fragment in sickle-cell individuals is interpreted as evidence of a
   mutation in the recognition sequence. Two nucleotide sequences close together on the same DNA
   molecule tend to stay together. In the sickle-cell DNA the beta-chain hemoglobin gene has become
   linked with another gene that somehow alters the recognition sequence at which Hpa I hybridizes.
   Heterozygotes will have both long and short fragments, while a single type (short or long) will
   occur in homozygous dominant and recessive, respectively.

   Huntington's disease was studied by James F. Gusella and his research team, who used RFLPs to
   identify a marker. Testing a large library of human DNA fragments, Gusella et al. found the
   needle in the haystack. The enzyme used was Hind III. Four fragments have been identified in an
   American family that has members suffering from the disease. The presence of fragment A has been
   identified in individuals who suffer from (or will suffer from) Huntington's. Pattern A occurs
   in 60 percent of the population, as well as the Huntington's sufferers. A Venezuelan family of
   3000 members is descended from a German sailor who had Huntington's. This family had a strong
   correlation between Fragment C and the disease. Pattern C is much less common among the general
   population in this country. Many individuals do not wish to know if they will develop this
   disease; Woody Guthrie's children have chosen not to be tested.

   Cystic fibrosis (CF) has also been studied with RFLP technology. CF is the most common genetic
   disease in Caucasians.

  Radioactive probes | Back to Top

   Hemophiliacs suffer from defective Factor VIII, which can be detected in fetuses 20 weeks old. A
   more accurate test, which can also be administered earlier during pregnancy, involves the use of
   a radioactive probe (36 nucleotide RNA fragment) which hybridizes restriction fragments. The
   gene for hemophilia is 186,000 base pairs, and has 26 exons separated by 25 introns. Mutations
   in the gene can be detected by RFLPs. This technology has also been used to detect the single
   base-pair difference between normal and mutated beta-chains, a screen for sickle-cell anemia. A
   DNA probe has been developed that hybridizes with the gene for dystrophin. The previous
   screening for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy was a sex screen, with option to abort a male. The new
   technique allows differentiation between the healthy and diseased male fetus, so parents have
   more information with which to make an informed choice (if they chose). The hybridization only
   occurs if the normal dystrophin gene is present, no hybridization occurs in the DMD sufferer.
