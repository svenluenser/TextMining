                                                  F

   families  1. In taxonomy, term applied to subcategories within orders. 2. Term applied to a
   group of similar things, such as languages, chromosomes, etc. PICTURE

   fats  1. Triglycerides that are solid at room temperature. 2. A legendary pool player from
   Minnesota?

   fauna Term referring collectively to all animals in an area. The zoological counterpart of
   flora.

   feces  Semisolid material containing undigested foods, bacteria, bilirubin, and water that is
   produced in the large intestine and eliminated from the body. Frequently noted as "hitting the
   fan".

   femur  The upper leg bone.

   fermentation  The synthesis of ATP in the absence of oxygen through glycolysis. PICTURE 1 |
   PICTURE 2

   fertilization  The fusion of two gametes (sperm and ovum) to produce a zygote that develops into
   a new individual with a genetic heritage derived from both parents. Strictly speaking,
   fertilization can be divided into the fusion of the cells (plasmogamy) and the fusion of nuclei
   (karyogamy).

   fibroblast A term applied to a cell of connective tissue that is separated from similar cells by
   some degree of matrix material; fibroblasts secrete elastin and collagen protein fibers. PICTURE

   fibrous root  A root system found in monocots in which branches develop from the adventitious
   roots, forming a system in which all roots are about the same size and length.

   filaments  Slender, thread-like stalks that make up the stamens of a þower; topped by the
   anthers. PICTURE

   filter feeders  Organisms such as sponges that feed by removing food from water that Þlters
   through their body.

   filtration  The removal of water and solutes from the blood; occurs in the glomerulus of the
   nephron.

   first law of thermodynamics (conservation) Energy is neither created nor destroyed, it changes
   from one form to another.

   fitness  A measure of an individual's ability to survive and reproduce; the chance that an
   individual will leave more offspring in the next generation than other individuals.

   flagella long, whip-like locomotion organelles found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells;
   sing.: flagellum. Eukaryotic flagella have an internal arrangement of microtubules in a 9 + 2
   array. PICTURE

   flame cell  A specialized cell at the blind end of a nephridium that Þlters body þuids.

   flora Term collectively applied to all of the plants in an area. The botanical counterpart of
   fauna.

   flowers  The reproductive structures in angiosperm sporophytes where gametophytes are generated.
   PICTURE

   fluid feeders  Animals such as aphids, ticks, and mosquitoes that pierce the body of a host
   plant or animal and obtain food from ingesting its þuids.

   fluid-mosaic  Widely accepted model of the plasma membrane in which proteins (the mosaic) are
   embedded in lipids (the þuid). PICTURE

   follicles (ovary)  Structures in the ovary consisting of a developing egg surrounded by a layer
   of follicle cells. PICTURE

   follicles (thyroid)  Spherical structures that make up the thyroid gland; contain a gel-like
   colloid surrounded by a single layer of cells, which secrete thyroglobulin into the colloid.

   follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)  A hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary that promotes
   gamete formation in both males and females.

   fontanels  Membranous areas in the human cranial bones that do not form bony structures until
   the child is 14 to 18 months old; know as "soft spots."

   food chain  The simplest representation of energy þow in a community. At the base is energy
   stored in plants, which are eaten by small organisms, which in turn are eaten by progressively
   larger organisms; the food chain is an oversimpliÞcation in that most animals do not eat only
   one type of organism.

   food pyramid  A way of depicting energy þow in an ecosystem; shows producers (mostly plants or
   other phototrophs) on the Þrst level and consumers on the higher levels.

   food web  A complex network of feeding interrelations among species in a natural ecosystem; more
   accurate and more complex depiction of energy þow than a food chain.

   foraminifera  Single-celled protists that secrete a shell or test. Accumulations of the shells
   of dead foraminifera and other microscopic sea creatures form chalk deposits. PICTURE 1 |
   PICTURE 2

   forebrain  The part of the brain that consists of the diencephalon and cerebrum.

   fossil 1. The remains or traces of prehistoric life preserved in rocks of the Earth's crust. 2.
   Any evidence of past life.

   fossil fuels  Fuels that are formed in the Earth from plant or animal remains; e.g., coal,
   petroleum, and natural gas.

   fossil record 1. The observed remains of once-living organisms taken as a whole. 2. the album
   Meet the Beatles.

   founder effect  The difference in gene pools between an original population and a new population
   founded by one or a few individuals randomly separated from the original population, as when an
   island population is founded by one or a few individuals; often accentuates genetic drift.

   fovea  The area of the eye in which the cones are concentrated.

   freshwater biome  The aquatic biome consisting of water containing fewer salts than the waters
   in the marine biome; divided into two zones: running waters (rivers, streams) and standing
   waters (lakes, ponds).

   frontal lobe  The lobe of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for motor activity, speech,
   and thought processes. PICTURE

   fruit A ripened ovary wall produced from a flower. PICTURE

   fucoxanthin Brown accessory pigment found in and characteristic of the brown algae.

   Fungi Nonmobile, heterotrophic, mostly multicellular eukaryotes, including yeasts and mushrooms.
