    Pollen

   Pollen grains (from the greek palynos for dust or pollen) contain the male gametophyte
   (microgametophyte) phase of the plant. Pollen grains are produced by meiosis of microspore
   mother cells that are located along the inner edge of the anther sacs (microsporangia). The
   outer part of the pollen is the exine, which is composed of a complex polysaccharide,
   sporopollenin. Inside the pollen are two (or, at most, three) cells that comprise the male
   gametophyte. The tube cell (also referred to as the tube nucleus) develops into the pollen tube.
   The germ cell divides by mitosis to produce two sperm cells. Division of the germ cell can occur
   before or after pollination.

    Pollination

   The transfer of pollen from the anther to the female stigma is termed pollination. This is
   accomplished by a variety of methods. Entomophyly is the transfer of pollen by an insect.
   Anemophyly is the transfer of pollen by wind. Other pollinators include birds, bats, water, and
   humans. Some flowers (for example garden peas) develop in such a way as to pollinate themselves.
   Others have mechanisms to ensure pollination with another flower.

   Flower color is thought to indicate the nature of pollinator: red petals are thought to attract
   birds, yellow for bees, and white for moths. Wind pollinated flowers have reduced petals, such
   as oaks and grasses.

    Gynoecium

   The gynoecium consists of the stigma, style, and ovary containing one or more ovules. These
   three structures are often termed a pistil or carpel. In many plants, the pistils will fuse for
   all or part of their length.

    The Stigma and Style

   The stigma functions as a receptive surface on which pollen lands and germinates its pollen
   tube. Corn silk is part stigma, part style. The style serves to move the stigma some distance
   from the ovary. This distance is species specific.

    The Ovary

   The ovary contains one or more ovules, which in turn contain one female gametophyte, also
   referred to in angiosperms as the embryo sac. Some plants, such as cherry, have only a single
   ovary which produces two ovules. Only one ovule will develop into a seed.

    The Gametophytes

   The male gametophyte develops inside the pollen grain. The female gametophyte develops inside
   the ovule. In flowering plants, gametophyte phases are reduced to a few cells dependant for
   their nutrition on the sporophyte phase. This is the reverse of the pattern seen in the
   nonvascular plant groups liverworts, mosses, and hornworts (the Bryophyta).

   Angiosperm male gametophytes have two haploid nuclei (the germ nucleus and tube nucleus)
   contained within the exine of the pollen grain (or microspore).

   Female gametophytes of flowering plants develop within the ovule (megaspore) contained within an
   ovary at the base of the pistil of the flower. There are usually eight (haploid) cells in the
   female gametophyte: a) one egg, two synergids flanking the egg (located at the micropyle end of
   the embryo sac); b) two polar nuclei in the center of the embryo sac; and three antipodal cells
   (at the opposite end of the embryo sac from the egg).

  Double Fertilization | Back to Top

   The process of pollination being accomplished, the pollen tube grows through the stigma and
   style toward the ovules in the ovary. The germ cell in the pollen grain divides and releases two
   sperm cells which move down the pollen tube. Once the tip of the tube reaches the micropyle end
   of the embryo sac, the tube grows through into the embryo sac through one of the synergids which
   flank the egg. One sperm cell fuses with the egg, producing the zygote which will later develope
   into the next-generation sporophyte. The second sperm fuses with the two polar bodies located in
   the center of the sac, producing the nutritive triploid endosperm tissue that will provide
   energy for the embryo's growth and development.

  Fruit | Back to Top

   The ovary wall, after fertilization has occurred, develops into a fruit. Fruits may be fleshy,
   hard, multiple or single. View the Seeds of Life site for illustrations and information about
   fruits and seeds. Seeds germinate, and the embryo grows into the next gemeration sporophyte.

  Vegetative Propagation | Back to Top

   Many plants also have an asexual method of reproduction. Often some species, such as many
   orchids, are more frequently propagated vegetatively than via seeds. Tubers are fleshy
   underground stems, as in the Irish potato. Leaflets are sections of leaf will develop roots and
   drop off the plant, effectively cloning the plant. Runners are shoots running along or over the
   surface of the ground that will sprout a plantlet, which upon settling to the ground develop
   into a new independant plant.
